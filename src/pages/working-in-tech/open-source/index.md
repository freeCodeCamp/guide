## Open Source

Open source software is any type of software that is available to the public to see or to be downloaded for free, as opposed to closed-source or propietory software that is owned by an individual or company whose source code is not public. Anyone can create a open source project.

Open source projects are legally made open through a creative license. They are changed, maintained or abandoned by their creators at any time. Many open source projects have contributors that volunteer to add and edit code. Some open-source libraries are used by companies in propietory code and are contributed to by paid employees.
