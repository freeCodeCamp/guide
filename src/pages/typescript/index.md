## Typescript

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
If you have been in Java, Typescript is like Java version of Javascript. It is stricted and promote Object Oriented Programming

Also, it adds static typing functionality to JavaScript.

If you want to try out TypeScript without installation, visit the <a href='http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>TypeScript Playground</a>. 

To learn more about installation, see the [Installation Appendix](./src/articles/typescript/appendix-installation/index.md).

Static typing is one of the most useful features when it comes to programming. Always remember that bugs found at compile time are always better than bugs found at run time!
