## Converting am Pm to 24 Hour Clock

In the 12-hour clock format, the 12 hours before midday is 0:00–11:59 **a.m.**, and the 12 hours after midday is 12:00–11:59 **p.m.**. The table below shows how a.m./p.m. time is mapped to 24-hour clock time:

| 12-Hour Clock     | 24-Hour Clock |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| 0:00–11:59 a.m.   | 0:00–11:59    |
| 12:00–12:59 p.m.  | 12:00-12:59   |
| 01:00–11:59 p.m.  | 13:00-23:59   |

As such, conversion of a time that falls within the first 13 hours of a day involves simply adding or subtracting the **a.m.** or **p.m.** suffix, and conversion of a time that falls within the latter 11 hours of a day involves an additional operation of either adding or subtracting 12 hours.

### A Note on Leading Zero

Under the 24-hour clock format, a leading zero typically precedes hours that would otherwise be a single digit (for example, 05:00). In contrast, this leading zero is typically not required when using the 12-hour clock format.

### Examples

Converting 12-hour clock time to 24-hour clock time:

```
6:00 a.m. = 06:00

10:20 a.m. = 10:20

12:30 p.m. = 12:30

1:37 p.m. = (01:37 + 12:00) p.m. = 13:37
```

Converting 24-hour clock time to 12-hour clock time:

```
06:30 = 6:30 a.m.

11:30 = 11:30 a.m.

12:00 = 12:00 p.m.

16:35 = (16:35 - 12:00) p.m. = 4:35 p.m.
```
