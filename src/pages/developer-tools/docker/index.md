## Docker

Docker is an open-source software aimed at facilitating application deployment. 
It offers the possibility to build containers, including an operating system, libraries and all you need to run your application. Therefore, your application can then be deployed on any machine. 
Its lightweight structure enables you to run several containers on the same machine.

Similar to Github, DockerHub offers a wide variety of images (Ubuntu and others), on which containers are built.
