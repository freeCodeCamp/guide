# jQuery Hover Method
The jquery hover method is a combination of the ```mouseenter``` and ```mouseleave``` events. 
The syntax is this:
```
$(selector).hover(inFunction, outFunction);
```
The first function, inFunction, will run when the ```mouseenter``` event occurs.
The second function is optional, but will run when the ```mouseleave``` event occurs. 
If only one function is specified, the other function will run for both the ```mouseenter``` and ```mouseleave``` events.
