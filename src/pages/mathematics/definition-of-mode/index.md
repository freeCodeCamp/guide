##The definition of mode is the most common integer in a set of data
##For instance, if I had a set of data with integers 1,2,5,5,6,9,9,9, than 9 would be my mode. 
##As 9 occurs most often in the set of data it becomes the mode, which is often confused for the mean, which is the middle most point in the data.
