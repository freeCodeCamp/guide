## The Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

The Agile Manifesto | -
------------ | -------------
Individuals and interactions over | Processes and tools
Working software over  | Comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over | Contract negotiation
Responding to change over | Following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
