## Robotics

Robotics is about the systems that make up robots.

### Overview

There are a multitude of varieties of robot types and component systems.
Each robot usually is dedicated to a set of processes with clear objectives.
A robot consists of "tools" that it uses to accomplish processes, and some kind of control system to manipulate the tools.

## Essential things for Robotics.
Firstly, you need to have good amount of patience to ace in Robotics.
Well coming to the tech part..
1) Be good at any one programming language to have a good grip over code.
2) Learn RaspberryPi or Arduino for the proper understanding of electronics and logic.
  Now the difference between RaspberryPi and Arduino is:
  RaspberryPi is a SBC(Single-Board-Computer) whereas  Arduino is only a Microcontroller.
  So the difference between the above stuff is quite important.
3) Inverse Kinematics is very important for the designing part. 
  Here is a good resource to learn [Inverse kinematics](https://www.intechopen.com/books/industrial_robotics_theory_modelling_and_control/robot_kinematics__forward_and_inverse_kinematics).
  
  Putting together, these resources are good enough to kick start your journey with Robotics!
