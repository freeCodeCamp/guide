## Epics
An epic is a large user story that cannot be delivered as defined within a single iteration or is large enough that it can be split into smaller user stories. Epics usually cover a particular persona and give an overall idea of what is important to the user. An epic can be further broken down into various user stories that show individual tasks that a persona/user would like to perform.

There is no standard form to represent epics. Some teams use the familiar user story formats (As A, I want, So That or In Order To, As A, I want) while other teams represent the epics with a short phrase.

* While the stories that comprise an epic may be completed independently, their business value isnâ€™t realized until the entire epic is complete
