## Composer

Composer is a package manager for PHP packages. You use a `composer.json` file to configure the packages for a PHP project, similar to the `package.json` file in NodeJS projects.

### Install Composer

To install Composer, you first have to download it from <a href='https://getcomposer.org/download/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>getcomposer.org</a>.

You can then install Composer locally or globally. 

### Install Packages

Install packages with `composer install`. Composer will install the packages listed in the `composer.json` file to the vendor/ folder.

```shell
    composer install 
```
