## Bash command: mv

**Moves files and folders.**

```
mv source target
mv source ... directory
```

The first argument is the file you want to move, and the second is the location to move it to.

Commonly used options:
- `-f` to force move them and overwrite files without checking with the user.
- `-i` to prompt confirmation before overwriting files.
