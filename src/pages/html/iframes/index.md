## <iframe>
The <iframe> tag creates an inline frame, which is frequently used to embed an independent HTML document into the current document. It should not be confused with the < frame > tag, because altough they are similiar, they have some differences.

### Code Example
`<iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.google.com/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>`
