## Code Tag

The HTML `<code>` element displays computer code on a webpage. Most browsers display the contents of the `<code>` tag in their default monospace font.

The `<code>` element is not self-closing, and must have both opening and closing tags.

### Example

```
<p>This is how we style a link with CSS: <br>
  <code>a { color: #000; }</code>
</p>
```
