## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) 

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software that consolidates the basic tools developers need to write and test software in one application.

IDEs offer a central graphic user interface (GUI) that incorporates the following: a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, a debugger, and build automation tools.

Many IDEs are build for just one language, but mostly you can use any IDE for any language, with the right plugins, etcetera. Many are available, though, for every language that needs one, so there aren't too many constraints. 

Some of the most popular IDEs include:

* <a href='https://netbeans.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Netbeans</a> *Java*
