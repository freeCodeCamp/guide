## Graph Databases

<p align="justify">
A graph database is an online database management system with Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations working on a graph data model.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Unlike other databases, relationships take first priority in graph databases. This means your application doesn’t have to infer data connections using things like foreign keys or out-of-band processing, such as MapReduce.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Graph Databases are currently gaining a lot of interest, as they can give very powerful data modeling tools that provide a closer fit to how your data works in the real world. This can allow a large level of flexibility to represent your data in a way that makes the most sense to everyone involved, whilst still making the most of the complex interactions between it.
</p>

<p align="justify">
At it's most basic, a Graph Database is simply a Database Engine that models both Nodes and Edges in the relational Graph as first-class entities. This allows for you to represent complex interactions between your data in a much more natural form, and often allows for a closer fit to the real-world data that you are working with.

##### Relational Vs Graph Databases

<p align="justify">
Traditional relational databases, the powerhouse of software applications since the 1980s, work well when your data is predictable and fits well into tables, columns, rows, and wherever queries are not very join-intensive.
</p>

<p align="justify">
But there are rich, connected domains all around us that relational software isn’t so well equipped at dealing with.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Relational database-management systems (RDBMS) only model data as a set of tables and columns, carrying out complex joins and self-joins when the dataset becomes more inter-related. Such queries are technically complex to construct and expensive to run. Plus, making them work in real time while end users wait is not easy, with performance faltering as the total dataset size increases.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Hence the rise of another type of database, optimized for connected data: the graph database. Graph databases are compelling because they enable companies to make sense of the masses of connected data that exist today.
