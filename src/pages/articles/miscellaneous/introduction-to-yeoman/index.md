title: Introduction To Yeoman
---
Yeoman is a tool that allows you to generate barebones apps based on different software stacks using "generator" packages made by developers who want to make your life easier. These packages streamline your time developing and deploying websites using your platform of choice. We're using a full-stack MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS) generator called [generator-angular-fullstack](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) by DaftMonk.

Once you've completed the Challenge: Get Set for Back End Projects, use this guide to navigate the base structure of your new app and learn how to interact with the database as well as the user.
