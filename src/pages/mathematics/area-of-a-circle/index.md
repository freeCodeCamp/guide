## Area of a Circle

![alt text](http://images.tutorvista.com/cms/images/102/area-of-triangle.png)

The area of a triangle obeys the rule:
```
Area  = (base * hight) / 2 
```

The only thing needed, is pay attention where is the hight and where is the base. 
To never change it, remember that every triangle area is half of a square area made by two triangles.
