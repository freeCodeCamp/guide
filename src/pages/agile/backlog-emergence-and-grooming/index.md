## Backlog Emergence and Grooming

Grooming is the act of refining the Product Backlog during a sprint and is also known as Product Backlog refinement. 

From the Scrum Guide:
Product Backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. This is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog items. During Product Backlog refinement, items are reviewed and revised. The Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is done. Refinement usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team. However, Product Backlog items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner or at the Product Ownerâ€™s discretion.

The objective of grooming is to have enough Product Backlog items "Ready" for the next Sprint's Sprint Planning. 

Changing the Sprint Backlog is part of the ongoing Sprint and is not considered Grooming.
