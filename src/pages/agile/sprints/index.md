## Sprints

The Scrum methodology, in Agile Software Development, is generally focused around Sprints.

Sprints are short development cycles where the team agrees on very specific goals that need to be accomplished during each Sprint. The duration of a Sprint can last anywhere from 1 to 4 weeks. 

At the end of each Sprint, the team will conduct retro meetings to evaluate the progress that has been made, along with any challenges that may need to be discussed in order to make necessary adjustments that will better meet the overall goals of a project. All of this will be implemented in the next Sprint.
