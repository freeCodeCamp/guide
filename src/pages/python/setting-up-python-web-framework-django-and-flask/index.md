title: Setting Up Python Web Framework Django and Flask
---
In this article, we shall be discussing how to install <a href='https://www.djangoproject.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Django</a> and <a href='http://flask.pocoo.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Flask</a> - two popular web frameworks written in Python.

Perhaps you are already familiar with the widespread usage and community support for Python; in web-development. You might as well be aware as to what a web framework is; and the options available for Python.

In case these assumptions are untrue, you might want to take a look at this <a>wiki article</a>. If you are all caught up, let's go ahread with setting up Python web frameworks in your local development machine.

But it would be unfair if we completely ignore the <a href='http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/which-python/#the-state-of-python-2-vs-3' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Python 2 vs Python 3</a> debate.

## Wrapping Up

We have successfully installed the web-framework of our need. However, it's not yet complete. Most web applications are content and data driven - so we need a data storage. Or, a Database, if you will.

In next article, we would be discussing how to install PostgreSQL and use it with our Python web application.

A point to ponder - we have been using `pip` heavily, but we have barely said anything about it. Well, for now, it's just a package manager like `npm`. It has some differences with `npm`; but, you don't need to worry about that now. If you are interested, do check out the <a href='http://pip-python3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>official `pip` documentation</a>.
