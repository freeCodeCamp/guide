title: Hello World C
---

 ## Hello World

To write on console you can use the function `printf()` contained in the library `include <stdio.h>`

 ```C
 #include <stdio.h>

 int main(void)
 {
     printf("hello, world\n");
     return 0;
 }
 ```
Note: Here '\n' is actually an escape sequence special character that means 'a new line'.
 ## Output:
 ```
 >Hello World
 ```
