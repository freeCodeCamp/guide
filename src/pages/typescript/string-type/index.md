# String Type

Strings can be written with `''` single quotation marks or `""` double quotation marks.
Be consistent with your code and choose a style.

```typescript
let dog: string = 'Fido';
let activity: string = "Playing Outside";
```

Strings can be written using template literals:
```typescript
let greeting: string = `Hello, ${firstName} ${lastName}, thank you for attending the ${eventName} event.`;
```
