This article assumes you are dealing with a fair die, that is a die such that each face has an equal chance, or probability, of coming side-up when you roll it.
Since a die has 6 faces, any particular face has a **1 in 6**, or **1/6**, probability of coming up.
If you roll your die twice, each particular sequence of face-ups (for example a 3 followed by a six) has an equal chance of happening. As there are **6x6** = **36**  possible sequences the probability of any particular sequence is 1/36.
