## Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is a list of tasks identified by the Scrum Team to be completed during the Scrum Sprint. During the Sprint Planning meeting, the team selects a number of Product Backlog items, usually in the form of user stories, and identifies the tasks necessary to complete each user story. 

It is critical that the team itself selects the items and size of the Sprint Backlog. Because they are the people implementing / completing the tasks, they must be the people to choose what they are forecating to achive during the Sprint.
