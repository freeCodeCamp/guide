CSS frameworks are designed to simplify the work of the typesetter, eliminate errors when creating a project, and get rid of the boring monotonous writing of the same code.


Advantages of CSS frameworks:

    * Ability to create the correct HTML layout even for a not very experienced specialist.
    * Code uniformity
    * Increase development speed

Minuses:

    * Attachment to CSS style library
    * Redundant code
