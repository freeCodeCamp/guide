## Motherboard




The motherboard is the main circuitboard that makes up a computer. 

Every piece in a computer connects to the others through the motherboard. It contains space for the central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM), and connectors for other parts. Other things that may attach to the motherboard include sound cards, video cards (GPUs), network cards, hard drives, extra USB ports, and many other custom components. 

Most motherboards have many of these extra components pre-installed. On a standard motherboard, you can expect to find sound, video, USB ports, and network ports already. Other slots include dual in-line memory modules (DIMM), and Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCI-E). DIMM slots hold RAM, and PCI-E slots hold GPUs and other expansion cards. 

How do you talk to the motherboard? The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) is a way for us to perform simple tasks before the operating system takes over. The BIOS runs a quick system check and then hands control to the operating system. By pressing a key on the keyboard (F10, F11, F2, etc.), the motherboard can instead wait and let you poke around. This key varies by model, but shows up right when the computer turns on. 

Motherboards come in many different sizes, especially in laptops. For desktop computers, they are one of a couple of sizes. ATX (biggest), micro-ATX, or mini-ITX (smallest) are common to find in computer stores.
