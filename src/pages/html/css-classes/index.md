## CSS Classes

Classes are an efficient way of grouping HTML elements so that they can share the same styles.

---

When you're writing HTML you can add a class to an element like so: 

```html

<h1 class="superMan">"Here I come to save the day!"</h1>

<p> is a popular catchphrase that <span class="superMan">Super Man </span>often said.</p>

```

Then  in our CSS file we should add the special attributes to the class.  Make sure to use a period (.) when talking about classes.
```css
.superMan {
color: red;
background-color: blue;
}

```
 

Notice that classes have the prefix of a period (.) in CSS.
The other way to change details in HTML is by using ids, in which you use a (#) instead of a (.).
You can see the result of the above code <a href='https://codepen.io/Tlandis/pen/RLvomV' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>here</a>.
