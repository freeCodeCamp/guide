## Lang

In HTML, The Lang tag is used to declare the language of the whole or a part of a web page.

The lang tag also helps to assist browsers and search engines in knowing which language the text is written in.

### Examples

```html
<html lang="en">
</html>
```

The lang attribute can also be used to specify the language of a specific element:

```html
<p lang="hi">
  फ्री कोड कैंप
</p>
```

In the above example, "hi" denotes the Hindi language. Similarly, you can use "en" for English, "es" for Spanish, "fr" for French and so on. Most languages are simplified into their abbreviations of the language mentioned just before.

Refer to [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for the appropriate two-digit Language code.
