## Area of Triangles

The area of a triangle is the total enclosed space on the two-dimensional plane by the sides of the triangle.

The area of a triangle can be calculated by multiplying one half by the base * height

For example, if you have a triangle that is 3cm on the base and 4cm in height, then you can work out the area:

Areaa= .5 * 3 * 4 = 6cmÂ²

#### Terminology

* Base (b) - The length of one side of the triangle.
* Height (h) - The length of a line perpendicular with the base to the opposite point of the triangle.

#### Formula
__Area = 0.5 * base of the triangle * height of the triangle__

For example in the image above,

Area = 0.5 * a * h
