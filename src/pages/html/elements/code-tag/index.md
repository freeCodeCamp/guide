## Code Tag

When you write some text and would like to add some code and it to be rendered in a code-looking style, you can simply use code tag. Just like this:

```html
<p>Here's some code:<br>
  <code>const a = 1;</code>
</p>
```

It uses Monospace font family and gives that desired looks. We need to remember that code tag that is just a phrase tag. Sometimes it is better to include embeded code or gist from places like JSBin etc.
