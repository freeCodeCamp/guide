Supervised learning problems can be categorized into regression and classification. A regression problem is where you map input to a continuous output. A classification problem, in contrast, is where you map (group) inputs into discrete categories.</p>\n<h3>Regression</h3>\n<p>Given data about used cars such as their mileage, you can predict their market prices. Since price is a continuous variable, this is a regression problem. In another example, Microsoft released a web app that predicts age based on picture. Again, as age is continuous rather than discrete or categorical, this is also a regression problem.  </p>\n<h3>Classification</h3>\n<p>The regression problems above can be turned into classification problems. Suppose you want to look for a used car less than X dollars. Then the output would be if the used car fits the price that you set. Similarly, age prediction can be a classification problem if we are looking to predict if a submitted picture belongs to someone under 18, and therefore should not be allowed to buy cigarettes.</p>\n<h3>Discussion points:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>What is special about supervised learning?</li>\n<li>In what scenario would you use it in?</li>\n<li>Caveats or traps to think about?</li>\n<li>What are some example models?</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Example 1:</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem.</p>\n<h4>Example 2:</h4>\n<p>(a) Regression - For continuous-response values. For example given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture</p>\n<p>(b) Classification - for categorical response values, where the data can be separated into specific “classes”. For example given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.</p>\n<h4>Suggested Reading:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1854449/6873133">https://stackoverflow.com/a/1854449/6873133</a></li>\n</ul>',fields:{slug:"/machine-learning/supervised-learning/"},frontmatter:{title:"Supervised Learning"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/machine-learning/supervised-learning/"}}}});
