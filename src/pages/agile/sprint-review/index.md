## Sprint Review

A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint. The Scrum Team presents the results of of the past Sprint to the End User. The Sprint Review allows every participant to try out the new functionality.

The participants of the Sprint Review are the Development Team, the Scrum Master, the Product Owner, and the End User.

This is a four-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is
usually shorter.
