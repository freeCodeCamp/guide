## What is Powershell

Powershell is a command line shell and scripting language from Microsoft specially designed for automating processes across multiple operating systems. 
With some helpful built in "cmdlets" or commands and a wealth of documentation, Powershell provides a user friendly language to get 
started automating processes on your servers.  

With a focus on easy discoverability of its functions and object orienation, a end user is able to migrate their existing batch scripting to Powershell pretty easily.

They have also made the source available on Github at the link below.
