Colors can be added in CSS using several different methods, some of the simplest are using the name of the color, blue , for example. You can write it in CSS like this:

p {
  color: blue;
}

You can also use RGB, which stands for Red, Green, Blue. The rgb value use three numbers, each number represents the amount of that color. here 

Blue is written like this:

h1 {
  color: rgb(0,0,255)
}

Red is written like this:

h2 {
  color: rgb(255,0,0)
}

You can also use HEX value, #rrggbb, where rr(red), gg(green), bb(blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff.

Black is written like this.

p {
  color: #000000;
}

Red is written like this.

h2 {
  color: #ff0000;
}

There are other ways to add color too. When you want to find your speicifc colors you can simply google the name for examples of the HEX,rgb or just to see exactly what it looks like or to find similiar color names.
