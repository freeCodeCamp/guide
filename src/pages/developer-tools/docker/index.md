## Docker

Docker is an open-source software aimed at facilitating application deployment. 
It offers the possibility to build containers, including an operating system, libraries and all you need to run your application. Therefore, your application can then be deployed on any machine. 
Its lightweight structure enables you to run several containers on the same machine.

Similar to Github, DockerHub offers a wide variety of images (Ubuntu and others), on which containers are built.

### Features
Docker containers running on a single machine share that machine's operating system kernel; they start instantly and use less compute and RAM. Images are constructed from filesystem layers and share common files. This minimizes disk usage and image downloads are much faster.

### See also
- Docker Compose : to create and manage several containers at the same time.
