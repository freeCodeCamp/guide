# Image Editor

Developers/artists use image editors to manipulate or transform images. *Crop, resize, color-correct, composite (combine many images into one), or remove unwanted objects.*
Some are more popular than others, but they all have similar editing capabilities. The following sections cover some of their differences.

### Web App Image Editors

Web App Image Editors are available in-browser. In other words, you  do not need to leave your browser to work on an image. Example: the  ability to open images from a local folder/ url.

### Open Source Editors

Available as free downloads and open to user contributions to the software's development.

### Paid Editors

Paid Editors need either a one-time payment or are subscription-based. But, trial-versions are available to test out the software before committing to buy. If you happen to be a student, many times, there are discounts  available through a student email or ID.
