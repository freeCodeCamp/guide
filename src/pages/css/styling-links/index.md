## Styling Links

The `<a href="">` property is responsible for creating URLs and can be modified using a number of CSS styling properties, although it has a few by default:
1. Underline
2. Blue color

You can change these by adding changing the `color` and `text-decoration` properties.

```css
   color: black;
   text-decoration: none;
```

You can also style the link based on interaction using these properties, also known as link states:

- a:link - a normal, unvisited link
- a:visited - a link the user has visited
- a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it
- a:active - a link the moment it is clicked
