## Tautologies

A **tautology** is a formula (or boolean statement) which is always `true` regardless of the truth values that replace the variables in it. It is also called *universally valid formula* or a *logical truth*. 

There are infinitely many tautologies. Examples include:

    x OR ¬x  (This stands for "x or not x")
    
This formula has only one propositional variable, x. If you assign x one of the truth values `true` or `false`, ¬x will be assigned the opposite truth value. Hence in both cases, the formula evaluates to true.  
 
The opposite of a tautology is a **contradiction**, a formula which is always `false` regardless of the truth values that replace the variables in it.

A formula that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction is called a **contingency**. 

You can use truth tables to determine the truth or falsity of a complicated statement based on the truth or falsity of its simple components.
