The HTML `<section>` element represents a standalone section of functionality contained within an HTML document, typically with a heading, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it.

### Example
```html
<html>
<head>
<title>Section Example</title>
</head>
<body>
<section>
  <h1>Heading</h1>
  <p>Bunch of awesome content</p>
</section>
</body>
</html>
```
