## HTML5 Layouts

HTML5 provides semantic elements that defines the different parts of a web page.

The <code>&#60;header&#62;</code> element defines a header for a document or a section.  The <code>&#60;nav&#62;</code> element defines a container for navigation links.  The <code>&#60;section&#62;</code> element defines a section in a document.  The <code>&#60;article&#62;</code> element defines an independent self-contained article.  The <code>&#60;aside&#62;</code> element defines the content aside from the main content.  The <code>&#60;footer&#62;</code> element defines a footer for a document or a section.  The <code>&#60;details&#62;</code> element defines additional details.  The <code>&#60;summary&#62;</code> element defines a heading for the <code>&#60;details&#62;</code> element.
  
  Before, people used to use <code>&#60;table&#62;</code>â€™s to layout the content of their web page.  This is not a very advisable method to layout a page, as this becomes harder to redesign in the future.
  
  There are three options to choose from: (1) CSS Floats, (2) CSS Frameworks, and (3) CSS3 Flexbox.
  
  The CSS Framework that is frequently used is [Bootstrap](http://http://getbootstrap.com/).
  
  The CSS Float property makes designing a layout easy to learn.  However, floating elements are tied to the document flow, and thus may harm the flexibility.
  
  CSS3 Flexbox, is a new layout mode.  Flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout needs to accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.
