## CSS3 at Media Rule

Media rules can be used to make your site look different on different devices (desktops/tablets/phones) and on differently sized browser widnows.
To create media rules you need to create a _@media_ block in your stylesheet and specify a device type and browser window width.
For example, this rule
```
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  
}
```
will target all devices with browser window width more than 768px. All css rules inside this block will be applied to devices with width more than 768px.
