## Product Design
Defination
Design is a fundamental part of the history, culture and technology of societies all over the
world. It is a critically important process in the business and creative industries affecting
national prosperity. As informed by promotional activities such as those conducted by the
Australian International Design Awards program of Standards Australia, and by the Design
Singapore Council among many others, our quality of life is affected greatly by the products
that are developed by such collaborative design professions as engineering, industrial,
graphic, interior, fashion and architectural design. The related outputs from the design
process can have significant effects on our artificial and natural worlds: positive if they
contribute to our health and well being, and negative if they damage the environment in
which we and our neighbours live. Of course, many designed products give rise to both
positive and negative effects and this has led, for example, to the EcoDesign and Design
for Sustainability movements which aim to minimise the negative effects and achieve a
reasonable balance between the two. Design has also developed a significant media-centric
and political focus especially in the environmental context where climate change is a serious
contemporary issue. And there are other important trends that need consideration such as
where design is heading in the future: we know that it is becoming more people-centred
and that it is crossing discipline boundaries more often than in the past, but more research
needs to be done in terms of identifying future directions for this discipline especially at the
postgraduate level of studies.
In this section, we'll have guides to a wide variety of tools and methods used by product designers.
