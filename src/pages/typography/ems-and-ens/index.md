## Ems and Ens
Ems and Ens are a form of the punctuation mark called 'dash'. Although similar in appearance to a hyphen, they serve different purposes.

### Em Dash

Use an Em dash to denote a break in the sentence. Substitute it for a comma or to denote a pause in a sentence. They are also used to attribute a quote to a speaker.
An Em dash is one em wide - the width of a point size of a typeface.
For example - The noise from the neighbor's house$mdash;it's killing me.

* Command for an Em dash on a mac : Shift-Option-Hyphen
* Command for an Em dash on Microsoft Word  :  Alt + Ctrl + (minus)
* Em dash in HTML : **&mdash;** or **&#8212;**

### En Dash

Use an En dash as a replacement for the word 'to' or to denote a range of numbers. An En dash is half the width of an Em dash.
For example - The first world war lasted from 1914 &ndash; 1918.

* Command for an En dash on a mac : Option-Hyphen
* Command for an En dash on Microsoft Word  :  Ctrl + (minus)
* En dash in HTML : **&ndash;** or **&#8211;**
