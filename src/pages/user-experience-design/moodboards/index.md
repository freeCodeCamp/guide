A mood board is a collage-like presentation tool used to convey a style or idea.  They may be digital, or on foamcore or cardboard.  Many types of designers create mood boards, including graphic designers, industrial designers, and User Experience/User Interface designers.  A designer may make a mood board as part of the initial exploratory stages of a design project.

Mood boards can convey color scheme, type face, and specific imagery.  They can also explore tone and mood more abstractly.  A board can include video or sound in addition to static images, photography, and text.
