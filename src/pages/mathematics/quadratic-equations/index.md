## Quadratic Equations

_A quadratic equation_ is a function that is expressed as an equation or a graph.

The parent equation for a quadtratic function is **ax^2+bx+c**.

* 'a' determines how wide or narrow the function is.
  * If 'a' is greater than 1, the parabola will be wide.
  * If 'a' is less than 1, the parabola will be narrow.
  
* 'x' is any x-coordinates located on the function.

* 'b' and 'c' are the roots of the quadratic equation.

  Quadratic functions create a parabola, also known as a 'u' shape.
  
  The vertex of a quadratic funtion is the turning point of which the graph reflects itself (hence the vertex also relating to 'axis of symmetry', the line in which a quadratic function reflects).
