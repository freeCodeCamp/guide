## Fractions

A fractional number represents part of a whole number, a value between 0 and 1. They can be represented using decimals (e.g. 0.1), percentages (e.g. 10%), negative indices (e.g. 10 ^ -1) or fractions (e.g. 1/10).

A fraction normally has two parts which are divided by a line:

* Numerator: Represents the number of equal parts marking up the fraction. (above the line)

* Denominator: Represents the number by which the numerator is divided to make the fraction. (below the line)

The numerator and denominator are both integers (whole numbers).

A proper fraction is one where the numerator is less than the denominator.

Fractions can also be added after a whole number to increase its accuracy.

### Examples

1½ represents 1 + 1/2 or 1.5.

Not all fractions have decimal representations:

⅓ or 1/3 represents 1 divided by 3
