## Minimum Viable Product
The idea is to rapidly build a minimum set of features that is enough to deploy the product and test key assumptions about customersâ€™ interactions with the product.  

#### A Minimum Viable Product has three key characteristics:
- It has enough value that people are willing to use it or buy it initially.
- It demonstrates enough future benefit to retain early adopters.
- It provides a feedback loop to guide future development.
