## Version Control System

A version control system is a software tool that manages changes to a file or set of files over time.  The files could be source files, documents, or image files.  This software is also known as source control.

When files are under source control, a person can revert back to a previous version if the change is not wanted.  To see how a file has evolved, a developer may compare different sets of changes.  Source control also allows you to see who has made the change.

Some of the standard actions that you may perform are:
* Check out existing files.
* Check in new files.
* Show the history of the files.
* Add new files
* Update existing files
* Revert files to a previous version.
* Merge different versions.

An example of source control software based on the client-server model is Subversion.  The server manages the files under its control and tracks all the changes.  You use a client on your computer to interact with the server.

An example of a distributed version control system is Git.  With Git, each client maintains the full history of the file modifications.  This prevents one computer from failing and loosing all the file history.
