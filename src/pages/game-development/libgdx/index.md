## Game Development with libGDX

libGDX is a free and open-source game-development application framework written in the Java programming language with some C and C++ components for performance dependent code.

### Overview
LibGDX supports both 2d and 3d game development, and is written in Java. In addition to Java, other JVM languages, such as Kotlin or Scala can be used to program libGDX games. At it's core, libGDX uses LWJGL 3 to handle basic game functions such as graphics, input, and audio. LibGDX offers a large API to simplify game programming. LibGDX has an informative [wiki](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki) on it's Github page, and there are many tutorials on the internet.
