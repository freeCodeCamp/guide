A "brute force" algorithm is also known as an exhastive search algorithm. It involves testing every possible solution to a problem within the limits of the problem. The term "brute force" generally signifies a disrgard for algorithmic efficiency and instead places emphasis on a truly exhaustive test.

For example, take a chess game. A brute force algorithm that attempts to determine the next best move would consider every possible move by every piece on the board. A more intelligent algorithm might first check only the high-value pieces and determine a move if one of them is in position to do some damage to the opposing team.

For a single chess move, a brute-force algorithm might well be the best algorithm to apply; however, if you want to determine the next 3 moves to make, a brute-force algorithm ends up taking far too long and is impractical. A smarter algorithm is required.
