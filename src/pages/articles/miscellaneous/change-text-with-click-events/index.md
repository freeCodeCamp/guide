title: Change Text with Click Events
---
When a click event happens, we can use Ajax to update an HTML element with the following code:

    $(".message").html("Here is the message");

This tells jQuery to use the class `message` as the selector and to that, change the HTML to have the string provide, we can also add custom html elements wrapped in quotation marks.
