# Tuple Type

Express an array in which a fixed number of elements of types is known, but not the same.

```typescript
let arr: [string, number];

// This is correct
arr = ['Hello', 7];

//This is incorrect
arr = [7, 'Hello'];
```

When accessing an element outside the known indices, it will use a union type:

```typescript
arr[3] = 'World!'
// OK, 'string' can be assigned to 'string | number'

// Error, 'boolean' is not a 'string | number'
arr[5] = false;
// Error, 'boolean' is not a 'string | number'
```
