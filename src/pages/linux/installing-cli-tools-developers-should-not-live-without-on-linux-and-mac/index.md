title: Installing CLI Tools Developers Should not Live Without on Linux and Mac
---
This article is a short description on how to install key command line utilities that developers use everyday on Macintosh and Linux environments. The main CLI tools that will be shown are: Homebrew (Mac), Node and NPM, Bower, Gulp and Grunt.

## Installing Homebrew (Macintosh Systems)

Homebrew is 'The missing package manager for OS X'. It is a great tool for downloading and installing packages straight from your command line. This is not needed on Linux distributions because they already have package managers installed by default such as `apt-get` or `pacman`. To install Homebrew, simply paste the following command in your terminal:

*   `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

## Installing NPM

`NPM`, or Node Package Manager, is another useful package manager for downloading mostly web tools. Downloading `NPM` will also install the Node.js framework.

### Mac:

*   Using `Homebrew` type: `brew install node` and `NPM` should have been installed.

### Linux:

*   Using `apt-get` first type: `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo -E bash -`, then `sudo apt-get install nodejs`
*   Using `pacman` type: `pacman -S nodejs npm`
*   Using `yum` type: `sudo yum install nodejs npm`

## Installing Bower

Bower is a popular package manager that allows you to install front-end libraries. You can install it on Linux and Macintosh systems using `npm` with the following command:

*   `npm install -g bower` (Same command for both Linux and OS X)

## Installing Gulp

`Gulp` is a framework and CLI tool that makes development faster and more enjoyable by automating tasks developers find themselves doing over, and over again. Also, you can install `Gulp` through `npm`:

*   `npm install -g gulp-cli`

And in individual project folders:

*   `npm install --save-dev gulp`

## Installing Grunt

`Grunt` is another popular automation tool similar to `Gulp`. To install it, use `npm` again:

*   `npm install -g grunt-cli`

And that's that! With these tools your development process and content will be enjoyable and efficient. As you can see, the main tool to install is `npm` and it allows you to install many other great web oriented CLI tools.
