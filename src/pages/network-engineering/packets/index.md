## Packets

A packet or network packet is a specifically formatted packet of data that is transmitted over a switched network. Most, if not all, internet and intranet traffic is transmitted over a switched network using the TCP/IP network protocol. Other packet types include the CCSDS packet used in NASA Deep Space communications and the MPEG packet used for radio and television broadcasting.

A packet consists of control information containing data about the packet and the user data or payload. As part of the OSI networking model, the packet belongs to the data layer, which is Layer 3 of seven layers. As part of the four layer Internet Model, the packet is part of the Data Link or Network Interface layer.

The packet model of data switching provides the following components which cause it to be the choice for network data transmission:

- Source and destination addressing
- Error detection and correction
- Packet priority
- Packet length
- Hop count
- User data or payload
