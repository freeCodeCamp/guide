## Grunt

**Grunt is a JavaScript Task Runner.**
Grunt preforms repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc. After you've configured it through a Gruntfile, a task runner can do most of that mundane work for you—and your team—with basically zero effort.

It is run from the command line and can be downloaded by using **NPM** by entering the command `npm install -g grunt-cli`_(this will install it globaly)_ 

Grunt uses a `package.json` file for configuration
