## Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default

The `checked` attribute, exclusively usable with `type="radio"` and the `type="checkbox"`, is a boolean attribute ( you can check the challenge about the `required` attribute, boolean aswell, at this link: [use html5 to require a field](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/use-html5-to-require-a-field/)).

As boolean attribute you simply have to add the word `checked` to the `input` HTML element you want to set checked by default (the challenge requires you to set by default _the first_ of the checkbox and radio-buttons already present in the code).

Good luck!
