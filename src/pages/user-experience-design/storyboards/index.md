## Storyboards
Storyboards are essentially a series of illustrations that visually map out a user's experience with a product. 

They help to present products in a similar fashion to how movies get visualized out before filming.

In HCI, storyboarding is the key essential step before prototyping, as it sets the tone of the design and development of one's products.
