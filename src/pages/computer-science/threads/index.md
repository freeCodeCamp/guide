An application consists of one or more processes. A process is an executing program. Inside a process one or more threads run in context of the process.

A thread is a basic unit to which the OS allocates processor time. It is also called a lightweight process. It provides a way to improve application performance through parallelism.

Each thread belongs to exactly one process and no thread can exist outside a process. Each thread represents separate flow of control

### Advantages of Threads

Use of threads provides concurrency within the process 
Efficient Communication 
It allows use of multiprocessor architects to a greater scale and efficiency
