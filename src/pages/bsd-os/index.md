## BSD operating system

![BSD operating system, most notably freeBSD: the power to serve](https://www.freebsd.org/layout/images/logo-red.png)

### Overview

Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) is a group of related open source Unix-like operating systems (OS) with origins in early versions of Research Unix at Bell Labs.
FreeBSD is the most popular member.

BSD is configured for internet hosting, web hosting, and hosting many servers on one system.
It is the first OS to have added an internet protocol.
BSD OSes have a very strongly enforced time-sharing system, which makes them most useful where resources are shared between processes.
As a comparision, the Linux OS is known to be preferred for single-task processes such as supercomputers and desktops.
The effective BSD multi-tasking forced-interrupt part of timesharing gets in the way of dedicated single processes.

BSD includes a 'Jails' system which is somewhat analogous to Linux Containers --except with additional security and flexibility in implementation.

#### History of BSD

According to Wikipedia, BSD was developed by the Computer System Research Group(CSRG) at the University of California, Berkeley starting from the year 1977 up till 1995. Its history roots back to 1970, the time when the distribution of Unix from Bell Laboratories included the source code to the operating system and researchers were allowed to modify and extend the OS. In 1974, the OS arrived at Berkeley and after 4 years i.e in 1978, the first Berkeley Software Distribution(1BSD) was released, but it was not a complete OS and was mere an add on to Version 6 Unix.

Later on, in 1979, Second Berkeley Software Distribution(2BSD) was released. The 2BSD was a updated version of 1BSD and also included two new programs i.e. vi text editor and C shell, that persist on the unix system till date.

4.4BSD-Lite Release 2 was the final release of BSD that was released in 1995. CSRG was dissolved after this and hence the further development of BSD stopped. Since then, versions based on 1995 release of BSD has been maintained and those are FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD.
