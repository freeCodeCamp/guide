## Domain and Range of Quadratic Functions

The domain and range determine the possible values for variables within any given function. 

In the case of quadratic functions, the domain is almost always x = +/- infinity (x can equal any number).
On the other hand, range is determined by the vertex of the parabola. For instance, the range of the equation y = x^2 + 2 is y > 2 because y can't equal any number below the vertex.
