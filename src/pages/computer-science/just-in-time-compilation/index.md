## Just in Time Compilation

Also called as **JIT or dynamic compilation** - refers to when *compilation* takes place. The *time* in Just In Time refers to the *runtime*.
i.e. a JIT compiler compiles the program as it is running.

In comparison, the **AOT compiler** or **Ahead-of-Time compiler** compiles a program before it is run.
