## Minimum Viable Product

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a version of a product which allows a team to test their riskiest assumption with the least effort while capturing customer value. 

An MVP has three key characteristics: 
  
  * It has enough value that people are willing to use it or buy it initially.
  * It demonstrates enough future benefit to retain early adopters.
  * It provides a feedback loop to guide future development.
