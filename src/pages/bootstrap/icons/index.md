## Icons

The Bootstrap framework provides you Glyphicons for icon.
Bootstrap doesnâ€™t include an icon library by default, but it has a handful of recommendations for you to choose from. While most icon sets include multiple file formats, we prefer SVG implementations for their improved accessibility and vector support.



### How to use

To use Bootstrap icon create a span tag with base class `glyphicon` and  individual icon class.
Use it only on elements that contain no text content and have no child elements.

**Code Example:**

`<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search" aria-hidden="true"></span>`

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search" aria-hidden="true"></span>

`<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></span>`

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></span>

The Bootstrap framework provides you with over 250 icons called glyphs. They come in font format from the Glyphicon Halflings set.

### How To Use

To use bootstrap icons you simply create `<span>` tag and apply the applicable CSS class for the icon. A code example has been provided below.

**Code Example:**

`<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search" aria-hidden="true"></span>`

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search" aria-hidden="true"></span>
