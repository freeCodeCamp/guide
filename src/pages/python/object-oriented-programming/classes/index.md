## Classes

Python is an object oriented programming language.

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

## Create a Class

To create a class, use the keyword class. For example, to create a class named MyClass, with a property named x you can write:
`class MyClass:
  x = 3`

## Create Object

Now we can use the class named myClass to create objects:
`p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)`
