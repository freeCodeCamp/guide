 a is called the real part of the complex number, and b is called the imaginary part. 

#### Note
A pure imaginary number or a pure real number is also a complex number.

#### Examples
1. What is the real part of 2i+1?
A. Real part : 1

2. What is the imaginary part of 2 - 4i?
A. Imaginary part : -4

3. Is it a complex number z = 2i?
A. Yes , because we can write this number as z = 0 + 2i.

4. Is it a complex number z = 4?
A. Yes , because we can write this number as z = 4 + 0i.
