24 hour clock keeps the time from midnight to midnight. At the stroke of midnight, the time is 00:00 in HH:MM format and the time continues to increase to 23:59 and at the next minute, time is 00:00
Converting am to hour clock is just simple, just remove the am and you get time according to 24 hour clock format
Converting pm to hour clock is also quite simple, just add 12 to HH and keep the minutes unchanged.
e.g. 11:23 AM is 11:23 according to 24 hour clock format(just removed AM).
e.g. 10:10 PM is 22:10 according to 24 hour clock format(the time is PM, so kust add 12 to HH and keep the minutes unchanged).
