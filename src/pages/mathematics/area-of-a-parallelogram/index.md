## Area of a Parallelogram

A parallelogram is a four-sided figure in which the opposite sides and angles are equal. It can be considered as being made up of two same  triangles sticked base to base.

The area of a triangle is `1/2 * base * height` and the area of a parallelogram is the addition of areas of the two same triangles.
Therefore,
### Area of Paralleogram = base * height

### Example
Consider a paralleogram as shown in the figure.

Therefore, Area = 6 * 2.5 = 15 (m)^2
