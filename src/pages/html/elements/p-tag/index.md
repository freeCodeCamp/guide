## P Tag

The `<p>` tag stands for paragraph, which is the most common tag used to create lines of words inside the `<html>` document. Using `<p>` will be very useful because add the margin automatically between elements. It's possible to work without `p` but is counter-intuitive because -also- will be difficult to with the css file.

### P tag with other tags
The use of the `<p>` is complatible with other tags, allowing also to add hyperlinks (`<a>`), black (`<strong>`), italics(`<i>`) among others.

### Example
```html
<html>
<head>
<title>Paragraph example</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
  This <strong>sentence</strong> was created to show how the paragraph works in a <code>.html</code> document and to study code at <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp</a>.
