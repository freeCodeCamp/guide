## Colors

This CSS property allows users to set the text color for elements. Colors can initialized in different ways. 

Color name: 
h1 {
color: red; 
}

RBG values: 
h1 {
color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
}

Or Hexadecimal values: 
h1 {
color: #FF0000;
}

Modern browsers recognize 140 different color names, while using rgb values and hexadecimals will get you access to a wider range of colors to complement your design. The RGB color value is determined by rgb(red, green, blue). Each parament will have a value from 0 to 255 that defines the intensity of the color. The hexadecimal system works off the same premise with FF being the highest value and intensity. Thus redâ€™s value is #FF0000, because the highest value FF is in the red slot.
