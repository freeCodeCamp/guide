This section contains articles related to Mobile Hybrid Applications Development using frameworks such as Apache Cordova, Ionic Framework, and React Native.

##Ionic Framework

Ionic is one of the frameworks that allow developers to quickly build mobile applications using web technologies. It is build using Apache Cordova and uses the Angular Framework. The framework "converts" your html code into the respective native code for each platform such as iOs, Android etc. The apps can be stylized very well with the use of CSS and this makes for the production of beautiful native apps.

For more information on using the framework, refer here : https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/installation/
