## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. Bubble sort has a worst case runtime of O(n^2) since there are (n choose 2) = O(n^2) different ways of choosing a starting and ending element; this case only occurs if the input array is sorted in reverse order. The best case runtime is O(n) since it makes no swaps when the input list is already sorted.

### Example:

#### First Pass:
( 5 1 4 2 8 ) –> ( 1 5 4 2 8 ), Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1.

( 1 5 4 2 8 ) –> ( 1 4 5 2 8 ), Swap since 5 > 4

( 1 4 5 2 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Swap since 5 > 2

( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5), algorithm does not swap them.


#### Second Pass:

( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 )

( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ), Swap since 4 > 2

( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )

( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )

Now, the array is already sorted, but our algorithm does not know if it is completed. The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.

#### Third Pass:

( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )

( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )

( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )

( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )

#### Properties
- Space complexity: O(1)
- Best case performance: O(n)
- Average case performance: O(n\*n)
- Worst case performance: O(n\*n)
- Stable: Yes

### Video Explanation
[Bubble sort in easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdtq5uKz-w4)

This code will use bubble sort to sort the array.
```js
let arr = [1, 4, 7, 45, 7,43, 44, 25, 6, 4, 6, 9];
let sorted = false

while(!sorted) {
  sorted = true
  for(var i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if(arr[i] < arr[i-1]) {
      let temp = arr[i];
      arr[i] = arr[i-1];
      arr[i-1] = temp;
      sorted = false;
    }
  }
}
```
