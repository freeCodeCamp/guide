## Before Selector

The `:before` selector is used to create a psuedo element that is the first child of the element being styled. You can use the `content: ''` property to define the text content (e.g. "See More", "Read More", etc).

Generally the `:before` and `after:` elements are used for cosmetic purposes.

### Syntax
