# Types of Java Loops

Java has 4 types of loops - the `while`, `do while`, `for` and `for each`. While you can pick your favorite and use that almost everywhere, each of them has certain advantages in different applications.

You can use a _debugger_ (a lot of IDEs have one - check out [Eclipse](http://eclipsetutorial.sourceforge.net/Debugger-Tutorial-Companion-Document.pdf), [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/debug-visual.html), [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/debugging-your-first-java-application.html) etc.), [set up breakpoints](http://help.eclipse.org/mars/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftask-add_line_breakpoints.htm) and visualize how the following code about loops, works step-by-step.
