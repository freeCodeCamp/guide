Classes are used in CSS to add styling to HTML tags that use the specified CSS Class. CSS classes start with a period symbol `.example` and CSS attributes can be set within it.

```html
<div class="header1">
  Some Random Text.
</div>
```

```css
.header1{
  color:ff0000;
  font-size:30px;
 }
 ```
 
 In this example, the above div will have red text with a font size of 30 pixels. This is because it uses the `.header1` CSS class and the text size and color is set for that class within the CSS styles. CSS classes can be used for multiple HTML elements simultaneously.
