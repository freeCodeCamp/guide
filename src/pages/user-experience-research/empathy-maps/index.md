## Empathy Maps

Empathy is a major component of user-centered design. What does the user need and want? What challenges stand between the user and his or her goals? In User Experience design, empathy is achieved by conducting user research and using it as a roadmap to guide design decisions. 

Empathy Maps, like personas, are done at the beginning of the design process. They are used to synthesize user research to create a realistic, yet fictional, user representation. Empathy Maps are quick to sketch out and, though the content of the empathy map may change, common content areas include:

<ul><li>User Image - Since empathy maps are usually done quickly, you can include a small sketch of your user in the center of the map.</li>
<li>Thinking - What are the user’s motivations, goals, desires?</li>
<li>Doing - What action is your user taking? What is their behavior like?</li>
<li>Saying - What is he or she saying? Does it conflict with their actions? Use quotes and keywords.</li>
<li>Feeling - What emotions is your user feeling?</li>
<li>Pains - Are there any problems your user is facing?</li>
<li>Gains - What are the positive outcomes your user is hoping for?</li></ul>

Empathy maps may vary slightly, but this is the format you’ll see quite often. Once your map is complete, you can use it to discern your user’s needs.
