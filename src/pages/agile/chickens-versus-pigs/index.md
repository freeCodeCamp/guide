## Chickens Versus Pigs

"Chickens versus Pigs" refers to a story about a chicken and a pig, where the chicken proposes they open a restaurant called "Ham-n-Eggs".
The pig refuses, because while the chicken just needs to lay eggs, the pig has more at stake. **The Chicken is involved, but the Pig is committed!**

In an Agile, the team members are the pigs. They are commited to the product / project they are working on. If the team fails to complete the job, or fails to do it well, they have a lot at stake.

On the other hand, the chickens are for example, the client, other teams, or a high-level project manager. They would not really be impacted by the failure of the project directly. They are interested in its success, and might make contributions, but have lower stakes and thus have significantly less commitment to the project. 

Therefore Agile emphazises on <a href="/agile/self-organization">self-organizing</a> teams. The maxim is to let the commited pigs organize their work by themselves, because they know best. Chickens are only involved and would hardly fail to orginze and improve a working process from the *outside*.
