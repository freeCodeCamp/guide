## Let's Encrypt

Let’s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA), run for the public’s benefit. It is a service provided by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG).

The group gives people the digital certificates they need to enable HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for websites, for free, in the most user-friendly way it can. ISRG does this to create a more secure and privacy-respecting Web.


The key principles behind Let’s Encrypt are:

1. Free: Anyone who owns a domain name can use Let’s Encrypt to obtain a trusted certificate at zero cost.

2. Automatic: Software running on a web server can interact with Let’s Encrypt to painlessly obtain a certificate, securely configure it for use, and automatically take care of renewal.

3. Secure: Let’s Encrypt will serve as a platform for advancing TLS security best practices, both on the CA side and by helping site operators properly secure their servers.

4. Transparent: All certificates issued or revoked will be publicly recorded and available for anyone to inspect.

5. Open: The automatic issuance and renewal protocol will be published as an open standard that others can adopt.

6. Cooperative: Much like the underlying Internet protocols themselves, Let’s Encrypt is a joint effort to benefit the community, beyond the control of any one organization.
