# Bootstrap Icons

## Guidance and suggestions for using external icon libraries with Bootstrap.

Bootstrap doesn’t include an icon library by default, but we have a handful of recommendations for you to choose from. While most icon sets include multiple file formats, we prefer SVG implementations for their improved accessibility and vector support.

## Preferred
We’ve tested and used these icon sets ourselves.

* [Iconic](https://useiconic.com/open/)
* [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/)
* [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com/index.php)

## More options
While we haven’t tried these out, they do look promising and provide multiple formats—including SVG.
