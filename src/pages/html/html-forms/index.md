## HTML Forms

Basically, forms are used to collect data entered by a user, which are then sent to the server for further processing. They can be used for different kinds of user inputs, such as name, email etc. 

Form contains control elements which are wrapped around ```<form></form>``` tags, like ```input```, which type can be:

- ```text```
- ```email```
- ```password```
- ```checkbox```
- ```radio```
- ```submit```

Code example:
```html
<form>
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" name="username" id="username">
    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" name="password" id="password">
    <input type="radio" name="gender" value="male">Male<br>
    <input type="radio" name="gender" value="female">Female<br>
    <input type="radio" name="gender" value="other">Other
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

Other elements that form can contain:

- ```textarea``` - is a multiline box which is most often used for adding some text eg. comment. Size of textarea is defined by number of rows and columns.
- ```select``` - together with ```<option></option>``` tag creates drop-down select menu.


SOME MORE INFORMATION ON HTML FORMS.

HTML Forms are required, when you want to collect some data from the site visitor. For example, during user registration you would like to collect information such as name, email address, credit card, etc.

A form will take input from the site visitor and then will post it to a back-end application such as CGI, ASP Script or PHP script etc. The back-end application will perform required processing on the passed data based on defined business logic inside the application.

There are various form elements available like text fields, textarea fields, drop-down menus, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.

The HTML <form> tag is used to create an HTML form and it has following syntax âˆ’
    
    <form action = "Script URL" method = "GET|POST">
         form elements like input, textarea etc.
    </form>
