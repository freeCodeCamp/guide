## Algorithms

An algorithm is like a recipe. It's a series of steps one takes to achieve a specific outcome.

Some common types of algorithms include sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and compression algorithms. Classes of algorithms include Graph, Dynamic Programming, Sorting, Searching, Strings, Math, Computational Geometry, Optimization, Miscellaneous. Although technically not a class of algorithms, Data Structures is often grouped with them. 

FreeCodeCamp's curriculum heavily emphasizes creating algorithms. This is because learning algorithms is a good way to practice programming skills. Interviewers most commonly test candidates on algorithms during developer job interviews.

Interviewers most commonly test candidates on algorithms during developer job interviews due to the fact that a good program cannot be written without a good algorithm. Algorithm is important to a programmer the way a house-plan is important to a bricklayer.

This video demonstrates some popular sorting algorithms that are commonly taught in programming and Computer Science courses.
