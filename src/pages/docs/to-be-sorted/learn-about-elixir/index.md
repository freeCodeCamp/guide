[Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) is a [dynamically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_type_checking_and_runtime_type_information), [functional programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) which uses [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) VM.

It was created by [José Valim](https://github.com/josevalim), as part of an R & D project. The development of Elixir started in [early 2011](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/graphs/contributors); and it has gained huge popularity in last five years.

With an enthusiastic active community behind it, Elixir is quite the language that preserves sanity and brings joy in coding.
