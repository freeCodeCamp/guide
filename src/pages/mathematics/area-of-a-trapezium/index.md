## Area of a Trapezium

A trapezium is a quadrilateral that has only one pair of parallel sides.

T = h((a+b)/2)

To calculate the area of a trapezium, divide it into a rectangle and two triangles as shown below.

#### Terminology

**a:** First Parallel side of trapezium

**h:** Height of Trapezium

**b:** Second Parallel Side of Trapezium
                    
#### Examples

1. **a** = 20 units , **b** = 14 units, **h** = 12 units, A = 1/2(a+b)h = **204 square units**
2. **a** = 8.8 units , **b** = 4.2 units, **h** = 6 units, A = 1/2(a+b)h = **39 square units**
