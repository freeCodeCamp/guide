## MoSCoW

When people work on an agile project, they need some kind of method for deciding which tasks to work on, which features to implement first, which requirements are fundamental to the project and which are 'nice-to'haves'. The MoSCow method is one such method. MoSCoW is an acronym (with a couple of extra "o"s added to aid pronunciation) which stands for the following:

**M** - Must Have

**S** - Should Have

**C** - Could Have

**W** - Won't Have

It may also be written as Moscow, or MOSCOW.

The MoSCow method allows agile team members to give each piece of a work one of the four distinct priority types. Each type is clear and easy to understand, using non-technical terms. This method therefore gives clear visibility to the highest priority items in the current timeframe (for example, the current agile sprint) and allows every team member to understand how to prioritise their work.

The meaning of each priority type is typically understood as follows:

**Must Have**

Those requirements that are labelled as **Must Have**s are fundemental in the current timeframe. To be considered successful, every **Must Have** needs to be delivered. These are the most important work items. Typically, not delivering these would mean failing the current sprint.

**Should Have**

The **Should Have** items are very important to the project, however, they are not absolutely fundamental in the current timeframe. These are the second most prioritised items, after **Must Have**s.

**Could Have**

These are the third most prioritised items. Typically these are seen as the "nice-to-have" requirements. They will enhance the product or add an extra feature, but they are not as important as the higher priority items. These will only be delivered if time allows. 

**Won't Have**

**Won't Have** is sometimes called Would Have. These are the items that the team won't have time for in the current timeframe (or the items that they 'Would' do, if they had more time and/or resources).
