## Use HTML5 to Require a Field

The `required` attribute works with almost all possible types of the `input` tag ( it doesn't works because it doesn't make sense for the buttons-like types or the ones with a default value e.g. `type=range`) and force the user to leave at least a minimum mark of the interaction with the required input when submitting ( select _at least_ one checkbox, type _at least_ one character into a text box, etc..)

Its use block the form form submission until the the `required` condition woudn't be fullfilled

You can use the `required` attribute with a particular syntax: since it is a boolean value you might write just`required` without any value.

In this challenge you already have a form and a input element: it asks you to add the `required` attribute to the input element; remember that if something of the original code is modified or removed by accident you can always restart with a clean code using the `reset all code` button.

Good luck!
