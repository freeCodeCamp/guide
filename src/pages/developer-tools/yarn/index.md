## Yarn

Yarn is a package manager for the JavaScript ecosystem, which will help you manage your code's dependencies.

A *package*, or sometimes called a *module* is code from other people that aims to solve specific problems so you don't have to.

### Yarn & npm

Yarn uses the packages listed in the npm registry. Essentially, yarn is "just" another CLI (Command Line Interface) which aims to optimize the original npm CLI, while still accessing npm's package registry for a single source of packages.

If you've already been using npm, [this guide](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/migrating-from-npm/) will help you migrate to yarn.

The most prominent benefits of yarn over npm are that yarn is much faster and can be used offline, as well as the deterministic install algorithm. Having a deterministic install ensures that dependencies are installed exactly the same on any machine. Gone are the "but it works on my machine" issues.
