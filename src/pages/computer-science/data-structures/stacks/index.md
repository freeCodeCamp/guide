The stack is a last-in-first-out data structure. Like a stack of books, individual data in a stack is stored "on top" of one another, so that only the topmost data can be accessed at any time. Therefore, the first index of a stack is always the most recent item pushed onto a stack. The first item pushed onto a stack remains in the stack for the longest period of time.

Stacks can be implemented in several ways, but some common operations throughout stack implementations are as follows:

* **Push()** - this operation places a piece of data on the top of the stack
* **Pop()** - this operation removes the topmost piece of data from the stack
* **Peek()** - this operation returns the topmost element of a stack

There are many real-life implementations of stacks. An easy-to-understand example is utilizing redo/undo functions in editing. The most recent action taken in word or photo editing, for example, is the first action that is reversed (or popped off the stack of actions) when the "Undo" function is chosen. The very first edit that is made is the last action that can be undone.
