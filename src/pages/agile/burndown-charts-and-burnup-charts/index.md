## Burndown Charts and Burnup Charts
These charts are designed to be used together, as they give different but complementary information.

### Burndown chart
This chart is used to ask the question "how much effort is needed to end this sprint?". As we're given a deadline (the sprint end), it's important to know how many hours are going to be needed in order to end all the sprint's tasks. 

The chart itself is basic: in the x axis go the days and in the y axis go the points. When the sprint starts, the ideal line is drawn, with the value in the first day being the sprint total points and in the last day zero. The values in the middle are usually  proportional.

The idea it that, everyday, each team member states how many points assigned to them are remaining. This makes it possible to visually get an idea of whether everything is going as expected, faster or slower, as it is immediately put in the chart.

### Burnup chart
This chart, on the other hand, is used to ask the question "how much effort have you put so far?". This provides an idea of how much hours have been done in order to get the job done, no matter the actual progress.

The chart itself is basic: in the x axis go the days and in the y axis go the points. When the sprint starts, the ideal line is drawn, with the value in the first day being zero and in the last day the sprint total points. The values in the middle are usually  proportional.

The idea it that, everyday, each team member states how many hours have been executed. This makes it possible to visually get an idea of how many hours has the team dedicated to the sprint tasks, as it is immediately put in the chart.
