## Navigation Bars

Navigation bars are a very important element to any website. They provide the main method of navigation by providing a main list of links to a user. There are many methods to creating a navigation bar. The easiest way to create a navigation bar is to use an unordered list and style it with CSS.

Navigation Bars are mostly made up of `<ul>` lists that are horizontally arranged and styled.

While styling the navigation bars, it's common to remove the extra spacing created by the `<ul>` and `<li>` tags as well as the bulletpoints that are automatically inserted:

```css
   list-style-type: none;
   margin: 0px;
   padding: 0px;
```

**Example:**

There are two parts to any navigation: the HTML and the CSS. This is just a quick example.

```html
<nav class="myNav">                                 <!-- Any element can be used here -->
    <ul>
        <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
```

```css
/* Define the main Navigation block */
.myNav {
    display: block;
    height: 50px;
    line-height: 50px;
    background-color: #333;
}
/* Remove bullets, margin and padding */
.myNav ul {
    list-style: none;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
}
.myNav li {
    float: left;
    /* Or you can use display: inline; */
}
/* Define the block styling for the links */
.myNav li a {
    display: inline-block;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 14px 16px;
}
/* This is optional, however if you want to display the active link differently apply a background to it */
.myNav li a.active {
    background-color: #3786E1;
}
```
