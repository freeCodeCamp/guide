## Factorials

A Factorial of a positive number (i.e. greater than zero) <i>n</i>, which is denoted as <i>n!</i>, is simply defined as:

<i>n!</i> = <i>n</i> x (<i>n</i>-1) x (<i>n</i>-2) x ... x 1

It is important to note that <i>0!</i> is defined to equal 1 and <b>not</b> 0.

##### Examples:

- 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120
- 9! = 9 x 8 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 362880
