Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers

Linked lists have dynamic size which overcomes the limitation of fixed size in arrays. Moreover, inserting and deleting is easy in linked list, whereas it is an expensive operation when it comes to arrays because rooms has to be created for new elements and exisiting elements have to be shifted
