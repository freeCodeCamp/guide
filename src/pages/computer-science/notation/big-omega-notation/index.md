Just as Big O notation provides an asymptotic lower bound on a function, 立 notation provides an asymptotic lower bound.

立 Notation can be useful when we have lower bound on time complexity of an algorithm.The Omega notation is the least used notation among all three.

For a given function g(n), we denote by 立(g(n)) the set of functions.

```c
立 (g(n)) = {f(n): there exist positive constants c and
                  n0 such that 0 <= cg(n) <= f(n) for
                  all n >= n0}.
```
