# Built-In Functions

Java also has many built-in or pre-defined functions which are usually stored in the java.lang and java.io packages,
which are automatically imported in editors like BlueJ or can be imported using the following Syntax-
```java
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;
```

These comprise functions which make an otherwise long and hard task easier to do.
