## Breakpoints

Breakpoints are a vital concept in [responsive web design](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/html/responsive-web-design).  Breakpoints are the viewport sizes where css rules are selectively applied to ensure elements layout well on various screen sizes.  These breakpoints are set using [media queries](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/css/media-queries).
[This demo](https://codepen.io/Tlandis/pen/ReWGKY) shows how using three or more breakpoints make content layout better.
