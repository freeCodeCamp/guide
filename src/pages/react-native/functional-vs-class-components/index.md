## React Native - Functional vs Class Components

In React Native, there are two main types of components that make up an application - *functional components* and *class components*. These are structured the same as they would be in a regular React app for the web.

### Class Components

Class components are JavaScript ES2015 classes that extend a base class from React called `Component`.

```js
class App extends Component {
    render () {
        return (
            <Text>Hello World!</Text>
        )
    }
}
```

This gives the class `App` access to the React lifecycle methods like `render` as well state/props functionality from the parent???

### Functional Components

Functional components are simpler; they don't manage their own state or have access to the lifecycle methods provided by React Native. They are literally plain old JavaScript functions!

```js
const PageOne = () => {
    return (
        <h1>Page One</h1>
    );
}
```

### Summary

Class components are used as container components to handle state management and wrap child components. Functional components generally are just used for display purposes - these components call functions from parent components to handle user interactions or state updates.
