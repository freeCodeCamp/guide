## Intro to Logarithms

Logarithms are mathematical functions used to find what power a base is raised to in order to receive a specific output.

*Here in the example variable b is the base whereas variable a is the desired output and variable c is the exponent.*

Logs are used in various things in the real world.  They are used in the pH scale, the measuring of the intensity of earthquakes (the Richter Scale) and many other things.

Example of logs in python:
```python
import math

# math.log(value, base) - outputs exponent
math.log(100, 10) #outputs 2
math.log(2, 2) #outputs 1
```
