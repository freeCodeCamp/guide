The B tag is used to make the text placed between the tags as Bold.
Here is an example on how to use them.

`<b>I am a Bold text </t>`

##### Note:
The text inside a B tag does not convey any importance it is just to make the text bold.
To make text bold and convey some importance <strong> tag is used.
You should not use B tag to make Heading bold rather use the Heading tags from <h1> till <h6>.
