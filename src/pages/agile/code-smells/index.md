<h1>Code Smells</h1>

Code smells are symptoms in code which hint that the code may cause problems down the line. As [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html) explains, “a code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system.”

While code smells aren’t always a problem and may not immediately affect the functionality of a program, they often signify bad practices or poor design and can make the system difficult to maintain and more prone to bugs in the future. A code smell can be viewed as a warning sign, an indication that the code could benefit from being refactored in order to improve its extendability, readability, and supportability.

Exactly what does and does not constitute a code smell is subjective and varies by language and development methodology.
