## Daily Standup and Daily Scrum

The Daily Stand Up (DSU) or Daily Scrum meeting is one of the key ceremonies of the scrum methodology.
As the name suggests, you hold the meeting daily, at the same time and, for a co-located team, in the same location.
The meeting should be brief, finished in less than 15 minutes.
The standard agenda for each person is
* What have you done since the last DSU
* What are you doing after this DSU
* What are your impediments / Where is help needed
