## Flexbox Direction
Now that you know what flexbox is, it's time to move on to how you can arrange content within a flex container. You can set this via <i>flex-direction</i>

There are 4 ways to set the flex direction

1. Row

The flex direction is set to row by default. This arranges all your content in a single row <b>without margins<b>. 

2. Row-reverse

This reverses your content in the opposite direction. Originally it was going from left to right, now it's going right to left.

3. column
