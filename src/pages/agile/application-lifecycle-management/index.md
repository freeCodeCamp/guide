Application lifecycle management (ALM) is the process of managing the life of an application, from idea to retirement and all phases in between.  As an organization's needs change over time, so do the application requirements.

Agile ALM uses Agile principles such as 'people over process' andthe 5Cs:

- Continuous Integration  
- Continuous Testing
- Continuous Deployment
- Continuous Insight
- Continuous Improvement

This approach leads to applications which are continuously responsive to business needs.
