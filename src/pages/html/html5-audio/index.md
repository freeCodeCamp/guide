## HTML5 Audio


With HTML5, you can easily play audio files in your website, using the ```<audio>``` tag.

Specify the source and type of your file inside ```<source>``` tag
   ```html
        <audio controls>
          <source src="horn.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>
   ```
An audio controller will show. You can play and control your audio from it.
