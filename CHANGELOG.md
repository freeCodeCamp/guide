API changes:

[Action creators](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/bound-action-creators/):

### New 1.0 sites launched

- https://www.vauxlab.com
- https://meetfabric.com

## [1.0.0-alpha16] - 2017-05-26
### Added

- Migration guide @kyleamathews #1032
- Made nodes fully immutable @kyleamathews #1035
- Add no-plugins example @scottyeck #1028
- Add support for "internal" plugins #1010
- Expose internal Gatsby data through GraphQL @kyleamathews #1014

### Changed

- Removed `updateNode` action creator as part of making nodes immutable in #1035.
Now sites/plugins should use `addFieldToNode` for adding fields to nodes created
by other plugins and `addNodeToParent` for adding a new node as a child to
an existing node.

### Fixed
- Don't override the default onClick handler in gatsby-link @scottyeck #1019

## [1.0.0-alpha15] - 2017-05-15
### Added

- Update version of React Router to v4 #940
- API proxy for use during development #957
- "static" directory for files to be copied directly into the "public"
directory #956
- Add `toFormat` argument to the ImageSharp GraphQL type so can change
format of image e.g. from `png` to `jpg`.
- React Docgen transformer plugin for parsing propType info from React
components #928

### Changed

- Change node format to hide most node-specific fields under an "internal"
key. Any code referencing `node.type` and others will need changed to
`node.internal.type` #960
- Changed the id for the root `<div>` used by Gatsby to mount React to `___gatsby`
- The default layout component should be at `layouts/index.js` not `layouts/default.js` https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/940#issuecomment-300537162
- `this.props.children` in layout components is now a *function* https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/940#issuecomment-300878300
- Change the default port for serve-build to 9000
- Change the path to GraphiQL to `/___graphql`

### Chore
- Upgrade Jest to v20 #935

## [1.0.0-alpha14] - 2017-05-05
### Added

- Use the Relay Modern compiler for extracting GraphQL queries from components.
This allows us to now support components being added to *all* components. This
means you can now write queries next to the views that use them. #912
- Hook for modifying pages #863
- New Drupal source plugin and example site #890
- Detect if a site's plugins have changed and when they do, delete the site
cache as it might now be invalid #927
- New way to make connections between nodes e.g. article --> author #902

### Changed

- Combine transformer and typegen plugins. The distinction between the two
types of plugins has proved somewhat artificial so they were combined. Any
typegen plugins in your `package.json` and `gatsby-config.js` need to be
removed. #918
- Gatsby now garbage collects old nodes. Source plugins should now "touch"
- nodes that haven't changed #861
- Due to adopting the Relay compiler, GraphQL query template strings need
named "graphql" plus must be named. So if previously you wrote:

```js
export const pageQuery = `
{
  allMarkdownMark {
    edges {
      node {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
`
```

You must now write:

```js
export const pageQuery = graphql`
query IndexQuery {
  allMarkdownMark {
    edges {
      node {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
`
```


## [1.0.0-alpha10] - 2016-11-17
### Added
- Did the intitial build of the new gatsbyjs.org! It's in the `www`
  subdirectory on the 1.0 branch and is built on each push! That's my
kind of integration testing :-) You can see the early version of the
site at https://gatsbyjs.netlify.com/. PRs welcome!
- Added <link preload> for page scripts. This speeds up loading scripts
  slightly by telling the browser to start downloading the scripts when
the HTML first starts being parsed instead of when the browser reaches
the end. This is especially helpful for large HTML documents on slow
mobile networks. [PR](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/558)

## Changed
- Use namedmodulesplugin instead of recordsPath for ensuring
  deterministic builds and long-term cachability. The [previous PR adding
support for recordsPath](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/533)
proved unpleasant as you had to build locally and commit the outputted
records.json which was confusing and annoying.
[PR](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/559)

## [1.0.0-alpha9] - 2016-11-04
### Added
- Put the routes module on `window` to support experimental idea. See
  this issue for more](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/537).
[commit](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/28e84f3aed480d1f5a8f9859172d1c6f531696d4)

### Changed
- Removed the package `sharp` as it's not used and is preventing Gatsby
  1.0 from being installed on Windows.
[commit](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/34fff74e6fb3cae88010b42f74d784382ead4031)

## [1.0.0-alpha8] - 2016-11-01
### Added
- Extension API `swOnUpdated` for when a service worker finishes
  updating. Use this to alert users of your app to reload to see the
latest version.
[commit](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/5173bdc5424e7c874b3f2abfad706cea2e38ebc3)

### Fixed
- hot reloading now fully works. Apparently you can't use function
  components for top-level routes on react-router with react-hot-loader
3.0 `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` [#532](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/532) and
[commit](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/36f2c169586ea30518639d7b1493e08e05befb73)
- Webpack needs the help of an obscure setting `recordsPath` to preserve
  module ids across builds. Big thanks to @NekR for pointing this out to
me. Previous to this change, loading changed JS chunks could cause a JS
error as the module ids the new chunk expects wouldn't match the module
ids from the older chunks.
[#533](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/533)

### Changed
- Disabled hard-source-webpack-plugin. It speeds up builds significantly
  but has been causing hard-to-debug errors while developing. We'll
circle back to it down the road.
[commit](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/4bc9660ac8c371d23c0295cde52002775eee5aa1)
- Restored using ChunkManifestPlugin. It was disabled while trying to
  debug the mismatched module id bug but that being fixed, we're using
it again.
[commit](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/8d16905f31b80ca56db225904d60ed78c6091ca9)
- Name modules ids in development for easier debugging. Primary benefit
  is you can see which modules are getting hot reloaded.
[commit](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/93f6bd2c4206e71623c1a7fa007322f8dc9887be)

## [1.0.0-alpha7] - 2016-10-27
### Fixed
- Removed entries from the webpack config looking for
  `node_modules/gatsby/node_modules`. This was added to help when
developing Gatsby using `npm link` but when Gatsby is installed
regularly, it then fails the Webpack validation as
`node_modules/gatsby/node_modules` doesn't now exist.

## [1.0.0-alpha6] - 2016-10-27
### Added
- extension API for adding types to the GraphQL schema
  [commit](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/18b8b64ed4cbe3399fb262395c0c6e6a5a16099a)

### Fixed
- Use babel-traverse instead of using babel-plugin so that don't say
  done early when running graphql queries that have async resolvers
[commit](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/a19677e38d1ce8ba4fb39ddff75482904f168db6)

## [1.0.0-alpha5] - 2016-10-14
### Added
- hard-source-webpack-plugin
  [commit](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/2c48e5c42887fecabc01c5f5b6f3dd8e06d3372f)
- New replacement API to wrap root component (useful for Redux, et
  al.)
[commit](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/ebd57d2bd6c39b51a455b76018737e2957e146ef)
- yarn.lock
  [commit](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/5ce3321b84e912925c4705ececef6f2c817b0684)

### Changed
- Disable extracting the Webpack chunk manifest until understand why
  this breaks updates when using Service Workers
[commit](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/07ed5b010ad27b1816084b361f06fd0ae6a017ba)

## [1.0.0-alpha4] - 2016-10-07
### Added
- Add more file extensions to file/url loader config. Default to url
  loader unless it never makes sense to use data-uri e.g. favicons.
- Use api-runner-browser for calling browser extension
  APIs/replacements. Prep for plugin system.
- Add extension API `clientEntry` that let's site code and plugins to
  run code at the very start of client app.

### Changed
- Add config to uglify to ignore ie8.
- Disable building AppCache until can research if useful.
- Turn on screw_ie8 options in UglifyJS.

### Fixed
- Actually use the "sources" key from gatsby-config.js for looking for
markdown files. This will be getting an overhaul soon.
- Don't use null-loader for css during the build-js stage as this
  prevents offline-plugin from caching files referenced in your CSS.
- Add missing publicPath for build-html step.

## [1.0.0-alpha3] - 2016-10-05
### Added
- Introduce way to programatically add components to `<head>` + API to take over SSR rendering [a39c2a5](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/a39c2a5)
- Extract webpack manifest from commons.js so it doesn't change on every
  build improving its cachability
[0941d33](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/0941d33)
- Always add babel-plugin-add-module-exports
  [97f083d](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/97f083d)

### Changed
- Upgraded React Hot Loader to 3.0-beta5
  [5185c3a](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/5185c3a)

### Fixed
- Ensure bundle names for components and paths are unique [342030d](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/342030d)
  [a1dfe19](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/a1dfe19)
- Remove old code loading config.toml
  [66f901](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/66f901)

## [1.0.0-alpha2] - 2016-09-21
### Added
- New system for specifying page layouts inspired by Jekyll.
- `<HTMLScripts />` and `<HTMLStyles />` helper components for rendering
  correct scripts and styles in your html.js,
- Validate at runtime gatsby-config.js and page objects.
- Start of new plugin system.
- New extension API: `onPostCreatePages` — called with pages after all
  pages are created. Useful for programmatically modifying pages created
in plugins.

### Changed
- Removed remaining 0.x code
- Exit if can't find local install of Gatsby.
  [030f655](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/030f655075be5ad91af1dc12a05e6bd153a861df)
- Fix folder hierarchy for looking for loaders and modules #435
- Changed default `Config` GraphQL type to `Site` and added some
  Jekyll-inspired fields.

## [1.0.0-alpha1] - 2016-09-02
### Added
- Initial versions of new GraphQL data layer, PRPL pattern, programmatic routes, code
  splitting, supporting long-term caching of JS files.
