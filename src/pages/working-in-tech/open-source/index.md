## Open Source

Open source software is any type of software that is available to the public to see or to be downloaded for free. Anyone is capable of creating a open source project.

Open source projects are legally made open through a creative license. They are changed, maintained or abandoned by their creators at any time. Many open source projects have contributors that volunteer to add and edit code, and a growing number of open source projects are taking a major place among the most popular softwares available today.

In short, the Open source softwares are of **lower cost**, **higher security** and **better quality** when compared to propreitary softwares.

One of the biggest Open Source project is Linux.

**ADVANTAGES OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE**
Open source is not dependent on the company or author that originally created it. In a situation in which the company fails, the code continues to exist and the users will keep developing it. Also, it uses open standards accessible to everyone; thus, it does not have the problem of incompatible formats that exist in proprietary software.

Also, the companies using open-source software do not have to think about complex licensing models and do not need anti-piracy measures like product activation or serial number.

**DISADVANTAGES OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE**
The main disadvantage of open-source software is not very straightforward to use. Open-source operating systems like Linux cannot be learned in a day. They require continuous effort and training from your side before you are able to master them. You may need to hire a trained person to make things easier, but this will incur additional costs.
