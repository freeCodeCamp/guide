title: Singleton
---

The singleton is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. It is useful when you want to give only one object the ability to coordinate actions across your application.

## Singleton in Android
Singleton is a design pattern often used in Android. It is easily misused and so can cause app to be hard to maintain. It is useful in Android beause they live across fragments, activities, and rotations. 

- Singletons are often used in Android to store temporary data
- They allow the application to have one owner of the data and provides an easy way to pass data between controller classes
- Singletons are destroyed when Android removes your app from memory
- Singletons can make it difficult to unit test your app

```java
public class DataStore {
  private static DataStore sDataStore;
  private List<Data> mData;
  
  public static DataStore get(Context context) {
    if (sDataStore == null) {
      sDataStore = new DataStore(context);
    }
    return sDataStore;
  }
  
  // Make constructor private to prevent other classes from creating a DataStore instance
  private DataStore(Context context) {
    mData = new ArrayList<>();
  }
  
  // The only way for other classes to get data from DataStore
  public List<Data> getData() {
    return mData;
  }
}
```
## Singleton in PHP

> A private constructor is used to prevent the direct creation of objects from the class.
> The only way to create an instance from the class is by using a static method that creates the object only if it wasn't already created.

```php
Class Singleton {

  // Hold the class instance
  private static $instance = null;
  
  /**
  * The constructor is private
  * it is ensure the class can be initialized only from itself
  */
  private function __construct(){}
 
  /**
  * Return the singleton instance of this class
  *
  * @return Singleton
  */
  public static function getInstance()
  {
    if (self::$instance == null)
    {
      self::$instance = new Singleton();
    }
 
    return self::$instance;
  }

}

$obj1 = Singleton::getInstance();
$obj2 = Singleton::getInstance();

```
## Singleton in C#
The most elegant, simple and highly performant version of the pattern using [System.Lazy\<T\>](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd642331.aspx) type from .NET 4.0 or higher.
```csharp
public sealed class Singleton
{
    private static readonly Lazy<Singleton> lazy = new Lazy<Singleton>(() => new Singleton());
    
    public static Singleton Instance { get { return lazy.Value; } }
   
    private Singleton()
    {
    }
}
```

## Singleton in Python3

We can use metaclass to implement Singleton in Python3.

```python
class Singleton(type):
    # Mapping from a class to its singleton instance
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in Singleton._instances:
            Singleton._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)

        return Singleton._instances[cls]


class MyClass(metaclass=Singleton):
    pass
```

### Testing

```python
obj_0 = MyClass()
obj_1 = MyClass()

In [2]: obj_0
Out[2]: <__main__.MyClass at 0x111130da0>

In [3]: obj_1
Out[3]: <__main__.MyClass at 0x111130da0>
```
