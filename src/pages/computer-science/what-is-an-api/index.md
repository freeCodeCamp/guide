## What is an API

API stands for Application Programming Interface. Don’t worry about the AP, just focus on the I. An API is an interface. You use interfaces all the time. A computer operating system is an interface. Buttons in an elevator are an interface. A gas pedal in a car is an interface.

An interface sits on top of a complicated system and simplifies certain tasks, a middleman that saves you from needing to know all the details of what’s happening under the hood. A web API is the same sort of thing. It sits on top of a web service, like Twitter or YouTube, and simplifies certain tasks for you. It translates your actions into the technical details for the computer system on the other end.

If you have ever programmed in an object-oriented language like Java or C++, an API is quite similar to the concept of a class. When we call a method on an object (such as ```.toString()```) we don't really care HOW the object is producing the result, all we care about is the string we get at the end. A call to an API works in the same way. For example, when we make a call to the Facebook API to retrieve a user's profile picture, we don't care about how the information is retrieved from the server. We just make the request to the API, let it handle all the complicated retrieval logic, and get our photo at the end of it all.
