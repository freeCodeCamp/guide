## AVl Trees

AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where  the height of the two child sub trees of any node differ by at most one .
If at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property. Lookup, insertion, and deletion .

Insertion, Deletion and search in AVL tree take O(logn) time where n = No. of node

The above tree is AVL because differences between heights of left and right subtrees for every node is less than or equal to 1.
