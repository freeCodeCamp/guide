To convert from unit centimeters (cm) to meters (m), you need to familiarise yoirself with division. 1 cm is equal to 0.001 m. In another word 1 m is equal to 100 cm. All you need to do to find the measurement in m is to divide the measurement in cm by 100.

#### Examples
1. 1 cm = 0.01 m (<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub></span>)
2. 25 cm = 0.25 m (<span class="fraction"><sup>25</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub></span>)
3. 200 cm = 2 m (<span class="fraction"><sup>200</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub></span>)
