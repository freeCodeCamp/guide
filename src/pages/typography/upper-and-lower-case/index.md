## Upper and Lower Case

The basic Latin letter forms are upper and lower case.

### Upper Case

UPPER CASE or capital lettering is typically used to provide emphasis (e.g., initial capitals, names, "shouting"). You can force all upper case lettering in CSS with `text-transform: uppercase;` or all initial capitalization with `text-transform: capitalize;`.

Small caps (CSS styling: `font-variant: small-caps;`) are not just smaller capital letters, but custom font glyphs (at least when done properly) that match the x-height of the lower case lettering. You can [use CSS to style small caps](http://blog.fonts.com/2016/09/punching-up-web-typography-with-capital-letters/) in creative ways.

### Lower Case

lower case or small lettering composes the majority of written text. You can force all lower case lettering in CSS with `text-transform: lowercase;`.
