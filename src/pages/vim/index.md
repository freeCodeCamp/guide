##note [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
Neovim is a fork from vim withe the objective to pave the way for a better and more openly community driven open source project.

One of the key changes of Neovim includes the core feature of access to executing jobs and tasks asynchronously in vim, which has been one of the most requested feature of vim since a long time. This can help improve performance of vim even further especially because vim will not have to block while a background job is doing something.
