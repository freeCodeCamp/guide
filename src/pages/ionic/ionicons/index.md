## Ionicons

Ionicons is a completely open-source icon set crafted for web, iOS, Android, and desktop apps.
Ionicons was built for Ionic Framework, so icons have both Material Design and iOS versions. 
When used with Ionic, the `ion-icon` component will automatically use the correct version based on your platform.
Additionally, when used outside of Ionic, both `ios` and `md` platforms can be chosen by the application.
