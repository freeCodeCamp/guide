Some people hate designing things, and that's okay. But one thing that they might hate _more_ is being sued for copyright infringement (for using content that someone else created without their expressed permission). 

Recently, I participated in a discussion on this topic and thought I'd share a handful of sites that I've turned to in the past for high quality, freely available content. If you are a designer, web developer, or just a blogger that needs some nice, shiny images, these will be right up your alley.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, but if you need some seriously high-resolution images to freely use - consider checking some of them out.
