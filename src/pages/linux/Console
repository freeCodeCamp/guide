## Linux Console

The Linux console is a system console internal to the Linux kernel (a system console is the device which receives all kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode). 
The Linux console provides a way for the kernel and other processes to send text output to the user, and to receive text input from the user
.
The user typically enters text with a computer keyboard and reads the output text on a computer
 monitor. 

The Linux kernel supports virtual consoles - consoles that are logically separate, but which access the same physical keyboard and display.
The Linux console (and Linux virtual consoles) are implemented by the VT subsystem of the Linux kernel, and do not rely on any user space software. 
This is in contrast to a terminal emulator, which is a user space process that emulates a terminal, and
is typically used in a graphical display environment.
