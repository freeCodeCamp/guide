## Td Tag

The `<td>` tag defines a standard cell in an HTML table.

An HTML table has two kinds of cells:
* Header cells - contains header information (created with the `<th>` element)
* Standard cells - contains data (created with the `<td>` element)

The text in `<th>` elements are bold and centered by default.
The text in `<td>` elements are regular and left-aligned by default.

### Example
```html
<html>
<head>
<title>Td Tag Example</title>
</head>
<body>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Header1</th>
    <th>Header2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cell A</td>
    <td>Cell B</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</body>
</html>
```
