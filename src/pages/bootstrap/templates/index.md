## Templates

### Overview
Templates are prebuilt toolkits that make spinning up a new web page a breeze. If you have a general idea of your desired layout, or if you want to browse through a library of common layout templates for ideas, Bootstrap templates take much of the tediousness, and frustrations away form the initial build process. This assistance helps you to focus on the finer details of the project instead of wondering why CSS is not cooperating.

### Getting Started
* Bootstraps official webpage offers "Themes" instead of templates. Themes are just fully built out starter projects, while a template describes just a prebuilt HTML frame. Themes cost money and perhaps help out the novice developer, while many templates are open source and only provide the preliminary layout elements needed.
* Below is a list of layout templates, made specifically for for Bootstrap. Have Fun!
