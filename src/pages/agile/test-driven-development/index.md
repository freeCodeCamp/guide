## Test Driven Development

Test Driven Development is when you write tests to drive your work. TDD has three steps:

1. Write a failing test
2. Write enough code to pass the test
3. Refactor - make the code better without changing its functionality

These three steps are often summarized as Red-Green-Refactor.
