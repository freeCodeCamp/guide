Assembly Language is the interface between high level languages such as C++ and Java, and binary machine code. High level code is compiled into Assembly Language code.

Assembly Languages are divided into different Instruction Set Architectures (ISA), which are basic instructions the CPU can understand and process. More complex instuctions from high level languages are decomposed by a compiler into the simpler operations in the defined instruction set. Different computer architectures have different ISAs. A few common ISAs are MIPS, ARM, Intel x86, RISC-V.

Assemblers decompose Assembly instructions into their respective binary representations. Assemblers replace the generic addresses of assembly code with explicit register and memory addresses of your computer.

Programmers will write code in Assembly if exicution speed and control are absolutely paramount. Otherwise high level languages are used for easier development
