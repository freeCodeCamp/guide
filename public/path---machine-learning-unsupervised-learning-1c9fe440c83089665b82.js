We can derive structure from data where we don’t necessarily know the effect of the variables.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Clustering: Is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or grouping in data. Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.</p>\n<p>Few more Examples:\nSuppose you have data for an E-commerce site. You have a list of people and things they have ordered online this last week. You can now use Clustering Algorithms and find the pattern in the data, predict the buying trend and formulate the business strategy as per the trend.</p>',fields:{slug:"/machine-learning/unsupervised-learning/"},frontmatter:{title:"Unsupervised Learning"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/machine-learning/unsupervised-learning/"}}}});
