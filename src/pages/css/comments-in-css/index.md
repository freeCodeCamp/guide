## Comments in CSS

Comments are used in CSS to explain a block of code or to make temporary changes during development. The commented code doesn't execute. 

The comment syntax in CSS works for both single and multi-line comments. You can add as many comments to your stylesheet as you like.

```css
    /*
        This is
        a multi-line
        comment
    */
    
    /* This is a single line comment*/
    .group:after {
        content: "";
        display: table;
        clear: both;
    }
```

By using CSS comments to make your stylesheets more readable, the CSS will be easier to maintain in the future for you or another developper.

/*
***
* SECTION FOR H2 STYLE 
***
* A paragraph where I give informations
* about everything that someone who reads the code
* but didn't write it would need to know.
* The asterisk around the paragraph make it more readable.
***
*/
