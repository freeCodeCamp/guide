## Containers

Containers are an operating-system-level virtualization. It is an operating system feature in which the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances. Such instances, called containers may look like real computers from the point of view of programs running in them.

The majority of current container platforms run a Linux kernel, however Windows has recently introduced their own server container platform.  Many people use the terms container and virtual machine interchangeably but they are very different in many ways.  A virtual machine abstracts the operating system from the hardware.  A container abstracts the application from the operating system.  Containers allow for light, agile deployment and the ability to scale out and back in quickly.
