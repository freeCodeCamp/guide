    Selects all elements that have the given class attribute.
    Syntax: .classname
    Example: .index will match any element that has a class of "index".
ID selector
    Selects an element based on the value of its id attribute. There should be only one element with a given ID in a document.
    Syntax: #idname
    Example: #toc will match the element that has the ID "toc".
Universal selector
    Selects all elements. Optionally, it may be restricted to a specific namespace or to all namespaces.
    Syntax: * ns|* *|*
    Example: * will match all the elements of the document.
Attribute selector
    Selects elements based on the value of the given attribute.
    Syntax: [attr] [attr=value] [attr~=value] [attr|=value] [attr^=value] [attr$=value] [attr*=value]
    Example: [autoplay] will match all elements that have the autoplay attribute set (to any value).
