## Developer Ethics

Developer Ethics describes the field of ethics when applied to the behavior of software developers.

According to <a href='http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>, the field of ethics (or moral philosophy) involves "systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong." 

Over the years, a number of organizations and individuals have attempted to codify developer ethics into a variety of oaths, pledges, and codes of conduct. 

Examples include:

* [**The International Standard for Professional Software Development and Ethical Responsibility**] (http://seeri.etsu.edu/TheSECode.htm) by the IEEE-CS/ACM Joint Task Force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices

* [**The Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics**] (http://computerethicsinstitute.org/publications/tencommandments.html) by the Computer Ethics Institute

* [**The Pledge of the Computing Professional**] (http://pledge-of-the-computing-professional.org/home-page/the-oath)

* [**The Trustworthy Coder's Pledge**] (https://medium.com/@BillSourour/the-trustworthy-coders-pledge-aa5ba046c5aa) by Bill Sourour

* [**The Programmer's Oath**] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36NgPu9OyRM&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbno-B4RmJHCDO0ZUKC2tpUQ) by "Uncle Bob" Martin

* [**The "Never Again" Pledge**] (http://neveragain.tech)

* [**ACM Code of Ethics**] (http://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-and-professional-conduct)

Common themes appearing throughout these examples include a commitment to honesty, integrity, and fairness.

To date, since most software developers do not belong to – and are not governed by – any official order, guild, association, or society, no single, codified ethical standard has been widely adopted.
