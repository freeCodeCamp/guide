# Bootstrap Icons


## Guidance and suggestions for using external icon libraries with Bootstrap.

Bootstrap doesn’t include an icon library by default, but we have a handful of recommendations for you to choose from. While most icon sets include multiple file formats, we prefer SVG implementations for their improved accessibility and vector support.

## Preferred
We’ve tested and used these icon sets ourselves.

* [Iconic](https://useiconic.com/open/)
* [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/)
* [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com/index.php)

The Bootstrap framework provides you with over 250 icons called glyphs. They come in font format from the Glyphicon Halflings set.

#### How To Use:

To use bootstrap icons you simply create `<span>` tag and apply the applicable CSS class for the icon. A code example has been provided below.

**Code Example:**

`<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search" aria-hidden="true"></span>`

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search" aria-hidden="true"></span>

#### Bootstrap Glyphicon Class List:
This is an example of the CSS classes that bootstrap provides for glyphicons. More of them is avalible <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#glyphicons' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>here</a>

`.glyphicon glyphicon-plus` This is bootstrap's plus/add icon.

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus" aria-hidden="true"></span>

`.glyphicon glyphicon-trash` This is bootstrap's trash/delete icon.

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-trash" aria-hidden="true"></span>

_Note: Do not include the dot in the HTML Class Attribute, referring to the classes with a dot is only used when adjusting the classes in CSS._
