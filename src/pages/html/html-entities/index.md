## HTML Entities

Some characters are reserved in HTML.
If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.
HTML (or Character) entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.

A character entity looks like this:

&entity_name;

OR

&#entity_number;

### Examples
To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60;
To display a greater than sign (>) we must write: &gt; or &#62;
