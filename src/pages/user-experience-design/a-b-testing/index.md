## A B Testing

Simply put, it is conducting 2 separate experiments with a variation to compare which of the 2 variants is the more effective one. 

Here is a simple scenario:

- We have a landing page that wishes to collect email addresses from viewers. 
- We are deciding between the color **green** or **red** for the color of the button. We do not know which color would be more effective in getting viewers on the page to click. 
- We put out 2 versions of the same webpage, one with a **green** button, the other with the **red**.
- We will then compare the performance of each webpage.
