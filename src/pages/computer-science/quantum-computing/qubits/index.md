## Qubits

A qubit is the quantum analogue of a bit, the traditional and most basic unit of computing. Whereas bits can only have two states which can be expressed as 0 or 1, qubits can express 0 or 1 as a "prescribed pair of normalised and mutually orthogonal quantum states labeled as {∣0⟩, ∣1⟩}" (https://www.quantiki.org/wiki/basic-concepts-quantum-computation).
