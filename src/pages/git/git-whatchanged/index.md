title: Git whatchanged 


Shows commit logs and diff output each commit introduces.

New users are encouraged to use git-log instead. The whatchanged command is essentially the same as git-log but defaults to show the raw format diff output and to skip merges.

The command is kept primarily for historical reasons, fingers of many people who learned Git long before git log was invented by reading Linux kernel mailing list are trained to type it.
