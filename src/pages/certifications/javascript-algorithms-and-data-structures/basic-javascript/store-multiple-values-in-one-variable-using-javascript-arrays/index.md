## Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays

Arrays allow you to store lots of different data, within a single variable. All you have to do is put the data in the array, seperated by commas. Like so...

```javascript
var arr = ["Code for change", 123];
```

Remember, an array is defined as a row of things. You're storing different data in a single 'row' (variable).
