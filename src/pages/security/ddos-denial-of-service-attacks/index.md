## Denial of Service Attacks (DoS)

A Denial of Service (DoS) is an attack that aims to prevent legitimate users access to a service. This could be done by overwhelming the target with illegitimate requests so legitimate ones are missed.

An analogy would be a lorry driver blocking a road in protest, slowing or even stopping traffic all together. 

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

A Distributed Denial of Service or (DDoS) is a subset of the Denial of Service attack. This type of attack typically uses a large amount of attacking computers to attack a single target.

Expanding on the previous analogy, a Distributed Denial of Service would be similar but may include many trucks and causing potentially much more damage. 

Due to the fragmentation of the attackers in a DDoS attack it can be extremely difficult to filter legitimate traffic from that of the attacking traffic. As such there has been a large increase in the use of these attacks for taking down websites and services worldwide. This was seen in the 2016 attack on the Domain Name Servers of Dyn who control infrastructure for many of the most visited websites around the world. This attack caused outages for many large sites like Reddit, Twitter and Netflix.
