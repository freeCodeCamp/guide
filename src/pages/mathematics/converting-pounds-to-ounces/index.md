## Converting Pounds to Ounces

**One pound is equal to 16 ounces.** Pounds and ounces are both measurements of weight. Make sure that you are using the ratio correctly.
```
If you have 16 ounces, you would multiply by 1 pound per 16 ounces, not multiply by 16 ounces per 1 pound.

A good rule of thumb is to make sure that when converting from pounds to ounces, the number should increase. 
When converting from ounces to pounds, the number should be smaller.
