## Canvas Dimensions

The `width` and `height` attributes will control the size of the canvas. These attributes control the size of the drawing canvas, not the actual rendered size.

In the above pen, both `canvas` elements have the same dimensions set through CSS. However, one has twice the height set through the `height` attribute, thus leading the exact same rectangle to become rendered at half the height.

This can cause problems when you want to make a dynamically sized canvas. For instnace, you may want to make a full-screen canvas, or use a canvas as a thumbnail.

In order to make the size of the drawing context match the rendered size of the `canvas` element, we have to force this in realtime. One common practice is to put the following handler in the `onResize` listener.

```js
// somewhere early in the script
var canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
...

window.addEventListener("resize", function() {
    canvas.setAttribute("width", canvas.scrollWidth);
    canvas.setAttribute("height", canvas.scrollHeight);
    console.log(canvas.offsetWidth);
});

```
