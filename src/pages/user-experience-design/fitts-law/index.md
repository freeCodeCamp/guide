## Fitts Law
Fitts's Law provides a model of human movement which can accurately predict the amount of time taken to move to and select a target. In human-computer interaction Fitts's Law is typically applied to movement through the graphical user interface using a cursor or other type of pointer.

The law describes a simple rule of UI design that the distance from one point to the next should be reduced, while having the target object be larger to reduce the amount of time for selecting a target. Ideally, the further the user has to traverse towards a target, the larger that target should be in order to make the interaction more smooth.
