Discussion points:

- Unsupervised learning doesn't have a correct answer i.e. you can't be more or less accurate in the output
- Learn "hidden" structure in data
- Clustering is classical example
- Group like things together
- Example use case: movie database with people's preferences, you want to cluster and see different types of people
- Example use case: grouping documents or articles of similar content
