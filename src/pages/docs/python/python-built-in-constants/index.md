[Constants](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html)

Three commonly used built-in constants:

*   `True`: The true value of the _bool_ type.
*   `False`: The false value of the _bool_ type.
*   `None` : The sole value of the type _NoneType_. None is frequently used to represent the absence of a value, as when default arguments are not passed to a function.
