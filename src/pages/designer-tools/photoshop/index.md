Photoshop is a photo editing and design software created by Adobe and part of the Adobe CC Suite. It can be used alongside other CC software such as Illustrator, Dreamweaver and Indesign. 
Photos can be cropped, retouched and adjusted with a wide variety of tools including colour and light changes, effects and layers. 
Speaking of those layers, they are very practical for design as well. Photoshop can be used for designing, painting and drawing (2D or 3D, even animation). It has collection of brushes, textures, fonts and effects you can use to create stunning visuals. You can also load new material that can be found online for free to enlarge Photoshops library. 
Photoshop is available for Windows and Mac, and even has a stripped down version for tablets which integrates with the desktop app.
