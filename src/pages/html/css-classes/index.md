# CSS Classes

Classes are an efficient way of grouping HTML elements so that they can share the same styles.

## Example

Add a class as an attribute to an HTML element: 

```html
<p>The catchphrase</p>

<blockquote class="superman">"Here I come to save the day!"</blockquote>

<p>was popularized by <span class="superman">Superman</span>.</p>
```

Then in our CSS file we should add the special attributes to the class.  
```css
.superman {
  color: red;
  background-color: blue;
}
```
 
Classes are denoted with a period (`.`) in CSS.
