## HTML Entities

In HTML characters like ```<```, ```>``` has special meaning. For example, if you use ```<``` character, browser will parse it as a beginning of an HTML element tag. Instead you need to use HTML entity&mdash;a string beginning with ```&``` and ending with ```;```. And for any special symbol there is an HTML entity.

| Character | Entity        |
|-----------|---------------|
| <         | ```&lt;```    |
| >         | ```&gt;```    |
| &amp;     | ```&amp;```   |
| &quot;    | ```&quot;```  |
| &mdash;   | ```&mdash;``` |
| &copy;    | ```&copy;```  |
| &reg;     | ```&reg;```   |
| &euro;    | ```&euro;```  |
| &pound;   | ```&pound;``` |
| &Theta;   | ```&Theta;``` |
| &int;     | ```&int;```   |

Alternatively you can copy/paste UTF-8 (uncode) charaters directly to you HTML.
