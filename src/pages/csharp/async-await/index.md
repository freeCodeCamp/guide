# Async / Await Keywords

The `async`/`await` keywords in C# provide convenient ways of managing resources-intensive applications, which are more common in front-end languages such as Javascript libraries. Methods that return `Task<T>` types can be crowned with the `async` keyword, and when calling these methods in an UI handler or service workflow, we can use the `await` on the methods to tell C# to yield the control back to its caller until the background job is finished. By yielding the control on resources-intensive calls, we are able to allow UI to be more responsive and make the service more elastic.

The core of the `async` and `await` are the `Task<T>` class. When using it along with the `async` keyword as the return type of a method, we indicate that the method has promised to return an object of the `T` type (for methods that wouldn't return any value, use `Task` as the return type instead). `Task<T>` is a sophisticated topic of its own, for more information, please refer to the official documents: [Task Class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task?view=netframework-4.7.1).

Once encountering `async` methods, the work will be queued in a thread-pool for execution, while the caller will continue its execution without waiting on the return values from the `async` methods. However, in most occasions, our UI and service rely on the values returned from the `async` methods: for example, when we query a local database using the `async` methods, we would eventually want to know what are the query results and act on them, synchronously. This is where the `await` keyword shall be used: if using the `await` keyword when invoking an `async` method, the caller will pause the execution until a result is returned from the `async` method, and mean while, the parent method will continue execution without waiting on the caller to finish. With that said, any methods that uses `await` keyword have to be an `async` function themselves -- this is enforced by the C# compiler as well, if using Visual Studio to write your C# code, the IDE will warn you if a method violate the `async-await` contract.

## Examples

1. Submit Form to the Server
```C#
private readonly string url = 'http://localhost:3000/api/submit';
private readonly HttpContent formContent = new HttypContent();

// Update the formContent object while filling up the form.

SubmitButton.Clicked += async (object, event) =>
{
  // When PostAsync is hit, the button control will release the UI, while the
  //   http post method is still waiting on server response.
  HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
  var response = await httpClient.PostAsync(url, formContent);
  Console.WriteLine(response.StatusCode);
}
```

2. "Latches" Synchronizer
```C#
public async Task<int> CalcDamage(Player player)
{
  // CPU-intense method, calculate afflicted damage done to the
  //   Boss based on the damage types, Boss stats (from static data),
  //   player stats, etc.
  // ...
}

public static async Task<int> CalcTotalDamage(IEnumerable<Player> group)
{
  var totalDamage = 0;
  foreach (Player player in group)
  {
    // each of the async methods are queued in the thread-pool and move on.
    totalDamage += CalcDamage(player);
  }

  // total damage done must be calculated from all players in the group
  //   before we return the result.
  return await Task.WhenAll(totalDamage);
}
```

## Cheat-sheet
- await: retrieve the result from a background async call.
- await Task.WhenAny: continue if any of the queued tasks is complete.
- await Task.WhenAll: only continue if all of the queued tasks are complete.
- await Task.Delay: hold for an additional period of time before execution.
