  * **Symbols:**  ∧  &  ∙ 
     "and"
     "although"
     "but"
     "even though"
     "however"
  * **Example:** P ∧ Q (pronounced "P and Q")
  * Definition: for the above premise to be true, P and Q must both be true.
    
* **Or**
  * binary operator
  * **Symbols:** ∨
     "or"
  * **Example:** P v Q (pronounced "P or Q")
  * Definition: for the above premise to be true, either P or Q or both must be true.

  * unary operator
  * **Symbols:**  ¬  ~  (or a horizontal line on top of the premise, P)
    "not"
    "it is not the case that"

  * Definition: The above premise is valid if: When P is true, then Q must be true. Otherwise, if P is false, Q may be either true or false. In other words, P → Q is logically equivalent to ~P v Q.
  
* **Iff** (if and only if)
  * binary operator
  * **Symbols:** ↔  ≡  "iff"
  * **Example:** P ≡ Q (prounounced "P if and only if Q")

* **Xor** ("eXclusive or")
  * binary operator
  * **Symbols:** ⊻  (or a plus sign inside a circle)
  * **Example:** P ⊻ Q  (pronounced "Either P or Q, but not both")
