## Brute Force Algorithms

Brute force is an exhaustive search of all the possible solutions for a problem. It is often easy to implement and will almost definitely find a solution (If there is one). The trade off here is the time required. In terms of Algorithmic complexity, it will be very time consuming and 'smarter' ways of solving problems should be employed whenever possible.
