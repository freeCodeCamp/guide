## Comment out HTML

Comment syntax is the same of every other HTML element:

Example:
```
<!-- code -->
```
 
 subElement | Description
 ---------- | -----------
 `<!--` | Opening tag
 code | Commented text
 `-->` | Closing tag
 
 If you want to comment just some elements in the code you want to wrap them in a comment element - create an opening tag before them and a closing tag right after.
 
Have fun!
