## Semantic HTML Elements
A semantic HTML element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of semantic elements would be `<form>` or `<table>`.

On the other hand, non-semantic elements such as `<div>` or `<span>` tell nothing about the content.

The purpose of semantic elements is to increase code readibility and offers no performance benefits.
