title: Introducing Else If Statements
---
If you have multiple conditions that need to be addressed, you can chain `if` statements together with `else if` statements.

    if (num > 15) {
      return "Bigger than 15";
    } else if (num < 5) {
      return "Smaller than 5";
    } else {
      return "Between 5 and 15";
    }
