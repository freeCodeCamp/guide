## Background Opacity

The opacity CSS property specifies the level of transparency of an element, that is, the degree to which the content behind the element is visible.

You can choose upto what extent you want to make the element transparent.
You have to add the following CSS property to achieve the transparency levels.

**Fully Opaque**
```css
.class-name{
  opacity:1;
  }

OR

.class-name{
  opacity:1.0;
  }
```
**Translucent**
```css
.class-name{
  opacity:0.5;
  }
Opacity value can be anything between 0 and 1;
```
**Transparent**
```css
.class-name{
  opacity:0;
  }
  
OR

.class-name{
  opacity:0.0;
  }
```
