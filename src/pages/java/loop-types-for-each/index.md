title: Java Loop Types for Each

# The Java For Each Loop

Also called the enhanced for loop, it is an extremely useful and simple way to iterate over each item in a collection, arrays as well as objects that implement the Iterable interface.

```java
for (object : iterable){
    // Statements
}
```

The loop is read as - for each element in the `iterable` (could be an array, collectable etc.). The `object` type must match the element type of the `iterable`.

```java
int[] number_list = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};

for (int numbers : number_list){
    System.out.print (numbers + " ");
    //Iterated 10 times, numbers 0,1,2...9
}
```

Output:
```
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

In the above code snippet, `number_list` is an array. If you don't know what this is, don't worry about it. An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type, but more on this later.
