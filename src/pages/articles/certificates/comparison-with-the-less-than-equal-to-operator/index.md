title: Comparison with the Less Than Equal to Operator
---
The less than equal to operator (`<=`) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than or equal the number to the right, it returns `true`. If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns `false`. Like the equality operator, `less than equal to` converts data types.

## Examples

      4 <= 5  // true
    '7' <= 7  // true
      5 <= 5  // true
      3 <= 2  // false
    '8' <= 4  // false
