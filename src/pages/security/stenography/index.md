Steganography differs from cryptography because it involves passing a message not by encrypting it, but by concealing it.
In the past, messages were hidden, for example, with lemon juice on a sheet of paper or with false letters containing more information than they seemed.
It was even common to shave the hair, in order to write a message on the skull, and then to let the hair grow back and finally reappear when the recipient was present to read the information.
Today, computer techniques have further improved these processes.
It is possible to hide information in images, texts, music etc ...
StegHide is a program for hiding information in image or audio files.
