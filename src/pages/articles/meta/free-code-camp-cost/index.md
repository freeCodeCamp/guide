title: Free Code Camp Cost
---
We will always be completely free for both students and for nonprofits.

Our name is Free Code Camp. We are a free code camp. If you had to pay us (or sign over future earnings), we'd have to change our name. And we are not going to do that.

Everyone working on our community and our open source projects is a volunteer.

We plan to eventually cover our operational costs by earning job placement bonuses from companies who hire our graduates. Note that we will not actually garnish any wages from our graduates - employers are already paying recruiters thousands of dollars to find successful candidates. Employers will simply pay the recruitment bonus to Free Code Camp instead of paying a recruiter.
