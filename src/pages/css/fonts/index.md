Font Size

Using font-size allows you to control the size of your text. There are several ways to do this.

You can use px, px stands for pixel, 1 pixel is just that and is very small. Try starting with 16px like this and then you can make it parger or smaller depending on your preference.

p {
  font-size: 16px;  
}

You can also use use em, 1em is equal to the current default font-size of the browser which is often 16px. It is used like this.

h1 {
  font-size: 2.5em; 
}

2.5em in this example is 40px , a fairly normal size for a header.
