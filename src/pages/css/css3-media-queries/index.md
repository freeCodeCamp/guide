## CSS3 Media Queries

The `@media` rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.
Examples: You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for printers, one for handheld devices, one for television-type devices, and so on.
Unfortunately these media types never got a lot of support by devices, other than the print media type.

Media queries in CSS3 extend the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.
Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:
* width and height of the viewport
* width and height of the device
* orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
* resolution
Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to tablets, iPhone, and Androids.
