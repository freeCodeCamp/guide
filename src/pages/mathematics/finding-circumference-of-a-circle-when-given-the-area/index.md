title: Finding Circumference of a Circle When Given the Area
---
## Background information

### Area of a Circle

A = pi * radius ^2

### Circumference of a Circle

C = 2 * pi * radius

## To find the Circumference of a Circle given the area

1. Solve for the radius of the circle

radius = (A/pi)^(1/2)

2. Input the radius into the formula for the circumference and solve. 

C = 2 * pi * (A/pi)^(1/2)
