In User Experience Design, personas are imaginary but distinct personalities. You define them to help in designing the product. 

Personas make it easy to gain empathy for the needs of the users, and to focus on features or styles for the product. 

Personas are effective if we assign a name, age, family & work background, and even a face.

e.g. Alice, age 27, post-doctoral candidate, commutes by bus for 30 minutes either way, uses an iPhone and a Macbook. 

Thus, to make a persona effective, the more personal the better.
