### CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It was first invented in 1996, and is now a standard feature of all major web browsers.

CSS allows for developers to control how web pages look by "styling" the HTML structure of that page.

CSS specifications are maintained by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/).

You can build some pretty amazing things in CSS alone, such as <a href='https://codepen.io/bali_balo/pen/BLJONk' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>this pure-CSS Minesweeper game</a> (which uses no JavaScript).
