title: Comment Your JavaScript Code
---
Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what it does. Any code in it will be ignored.

Let's take a look at the two ways you can write comments in JavaScript.

*   The double-slash comment will comment out the remainder of the text on the current line:

`// This is a comment.`

*   The slash-star-star-slash comment will comment out everything between the `/*` and the `*/` characters:

`/* This is also a comment */`
