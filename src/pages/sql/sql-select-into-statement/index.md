## SQL Select into Statement

The `SELECT INTO` statement is a query that allows you to create a *new* table and populate it with the result set of a `SELECT statement`. To add data to an existing table, see the [INSERT INTO](guides/src/pages/sql/sql-insert-into-select-statement/index.md) statement instead.

`SELECT INTO` can be used when you are combining data from several tables or views into a new table.<sup>1</sup> The original table is not affected.

The general syntax is: 
```sql
SELECT column-names
  INTO new-table-name
  FROM table-name
 WHERE EXISTS 
      (SELECT column-name
         FROM table-name
        WHERE condition)
```

This example shows a set of a table that was "copied" from the "Supplier" table to a new one called SupplierUSA which holds the set related to the column country of value 'USA'. 

```sql
SELECT * INTO SupplierUSA
  FROM Supplier
 WHERE Country = 'USA';
 ```
 **Results**: 4 rows affected <sup>2</sup>
