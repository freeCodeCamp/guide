title: Acceptance Testing
---
An acceptance test is a formal description of the behavior of a software product, generally expressed as an example or a usage scenario. A number of different notations and approaches have been proposed for such examples or scenarios. In many cases the aim is that it should be possible to automate the execution of such tests by a software tool, either ad-hoc to the development team or off the shelf.

Similar to a unit test, an acceptance test generally has a binary result, pass or fail. A failure suggests, though does not prove, the presence of a defect in the product.

Teams mature in their practice of agile  use acceptance tests as the main form of functional specification and the only formal expression of business requirements. Other teams use acceptance tests as a complement to specification documents containing uses cases or more narrative text.
