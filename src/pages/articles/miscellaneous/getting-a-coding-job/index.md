## Here are the facts:

*   There are hundreds of thousands of unfilled coding jobs.
*   Employers and the US government have joined together to promote nontraditional coding programs like Free Code Camp.
*   Full stack JavaScript is one of the best paying skill sets, and has a ton of job openings.
*   The best proof that you're an employable developer is a portfolio filled with real apps that real people are using.

You'll still need to develop basic interviewing skills and soft skills (if you've been working a knowledge-worker type job for a few years, you probably already have these).

You'll also need to work hard to network with coders in your city. You can do this by joining [your city's Local Group](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/LocalGroups-List) and participating in as many events as possible.

I've found [this](https://github.com/cassidoo/getting-a-gig) link to be useful. It does a great job of explaining the process.
