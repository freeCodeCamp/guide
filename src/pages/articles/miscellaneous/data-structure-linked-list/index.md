title: Data Structure Linked List
---
Just like a garland is made with flowers, a linked list is made up of nodes. We call every flower on this particular garland to be a node. And each of the node points to the next node in this list as well as it has data (here it is type of flower).

## Types

1.  Singly Linked List

Singly linked lists contain nodes which have a `data` field as well as a `next` field, which points to the next node in the sequence. Operations that can be performed on singly linked lists are insertion, deletion and traversal.

`

    Singly Link List

* * *

       head
        |
        |
      +-----+--+      +-----+--+      +-----+------+
      |  1  |o----->  |  2  |o----->  |  3  | NULL |
      +-----+--+      +-----+--+      +-----+------+

`

Application

Internal implementation of CPython, the frames and evaluated variables are kept on a stack.

For this we need to iterate only forward aur get the head, therefore singly linked-list is used.

1.  Doubly Linked List

Doubly linked lists contain node which have `data` field, `next` field and another link field `prev` pointing to the previous node in the sequence.

`

Doubly Linked List

* * *

              head
               |
               |
      +------+-----+--+    +--+-----+--+       +-----+------+
      |      |     |o------>  |     |o------>  |     |      |
      | NULL |  1  |          |  2  |          |  3  | NULL |
      |      |     |  <------o|     |  <------o|     |      |
      +------+-----+--+    +--+-----+--+       +-----+------+

`

Application

The browser cache which allows you to hit the BACK and FORWARD button. Here we need to maintain a doubly linked list, with `URLs` as data field, to allow access in both direction. To go to previous URL we will use `prev` field and to go to next page we will use `next` field.

1.  Circular Linked List

Circular linked lists is a singly linked list in which last node, `next` field points to first node in the sequence.

`

Circular Linked List

* * *

         head
          |
          |
        +-----+--+      +-----+--+      +-----+--+

--> | 1 |o-----> | 2 |o-----> | 3 |o----  
| +-----+--+ +-----+--+ +-----+--+ |  
| |

* * *

`

**Application**

Timesharing problem solved by the operating system.

In a timesharing environment, the operating system must maintain a list of present users and must alternately allow each user to use a small portion of CPU time, one user at a time. The operating system will pick a user, let him/her use a small amount of CPU time and then move on to the next user.

For this application, there should be no NULL pointers unless there is absolutely no one requesting CPU time, i.e list is empty.

## Basic Operations

1.  Insertion

To add a new element to the list.

`

Insertion at the beginning

* * *

*   Create a new node with given data.
*   Point new node's `next` to old `head`.
*   Point `head` to this new node.

Insertion in the middle/end

* * *

Insertion after node X.

*   Create a new node with given data.
*   Point new node's `next` to old X's `next`.
*   Point X's `next` to this new node.  
    `

**Time Complexity: O(1)**

1.  Deletion

To delete existing element from the list.

`

Deletion at the beginning

* * *

*   Get the node pointed by `head` as Temp.
*   Point `head` to Temp's `next`.
*   Free memory used by Temp node.

Deletion in the middle/end

* * *

Deletion after node X.

*   Get the node pointed by `X` as Temp.
*   Point X's `next` to Temp's `next`.
*   Free memory used by Temp node.  
    `

**Time Complexity: O(1)**

1.  Traversing

To travel across the list.

`

Traversal

* * *

*   Get the node pointed by `head` as Current.
*   Check if Current is not null and display it.
*   Point Current to Current's `next` and move to above step.  
    `

**Time Complexity: O(n) // Here n is size of link-list**

## Implementation

### C++ implementation of singly linked list

    // Header files
    #include <iostream>

    struct node
    {
        int data;
        struct node *next;
    };

    // Head pointer always points to first element of the linked list
    struct node *head = NULL;

#### Printing data in each node  

    // Display the list
    void printList()
    {
        struct node *ptr = head;

        // Start from the beginning
    while(ptr != NULL)
    {
        std::cout << ptr->data << " ";
        ptr = ptr->next;
    }

    std::cout << std::endl;
    }

#### Insertion at the beginning  

    // Insert link at the beginning
    void insertFirst(int data)
    {
        // Create a new node
        struct node *new_node = new struct node;

        new_node->data = data;

    // Point it to old head
    new_node->next = head;

    // Point head to new node
    head = new_node;

    std::cout << "Inserted successfully" << std::endl;
    }

#### Deletion at the beginning  

    // Delete first item
    void deleteFirst()
    {
        // Save reference to head
        struct node *temp = head;

        // Point head to head's next
    head = head->next;

    // Free memory used by temp
    temp = NULL:
    delete temp;

    std::cout << "Deleted successfully" << std::endl;
    }

#### Size  

    // Find no. of nodes in link list
    void size()
    {
        int length = 0;
        struct node *current;

        for(current = head; current != NULL; current = current->next)
    {
        length++;
    }

    std::cout << "Size of Linked List is " << length << std::endl;
    }

#### Searching  

    // Find node with given data
    void find(int data){

        // Start from the head
    struct node* current = head;

    // If list is empty
    if(head == NULL)
    {
        std::cout << "List is empty" << std::endl;
        return;
    }

    // Traverse through list
    while(current->data != data){

        // If it is last node
        if(current->next == NULL){
            std::cout << "Not Found" << std::endl;
            return;
        }
        else{
            // Go to next node
            current = current->next;
        }
    }

    // If data found
    std::cout << "Found" << std::endl;
    }

#### Deletion after a node  

    // Delete a node with given data
    void del(int data){

        // Start from the first node
    struct node* current = head;
    struct node* previous = NULL;

    // If list is empty
    if(head == NULL){
        std::cout << "List is empty" << std::endl;
        return ;
    }

    // Navigate through list
    while(current->data != data){

        // If it is last node
        if(current->next == NULL){
            std::cout << "Element not found" << std::endl;
            return ;
        }
        else {
            // Store reference to current node
            previous = current;
            // Move to next node
            current = current->next;
        }

    }

    // Found a match, update the node
    if(current == head) {
        // Change head to point to next node
        head = head->next;
    }
    else {
        // Skip the current node
        previous->next = current->next;
    }

    // Free space used by deleted node
    current = NULL;
    delete current;
    std::cout << "Deleted succesfully" << std::endl;
    }

**Advantages**

1.  Linked lists are a dynamic data structure, which can grow and shrink, allocating and deallocating memory while the program is running.
2.  Insertion and deletion of node are easily implemented in a linked list at any position.

**Disadvantages**

1.  They use more memory than arrays because of the memory used by their pointers (`next` and `prev`).
2.  Random access is not possible in linked list. We have to access nodes sequentially.
3.  It's more complex than array. If a language supports array bound check automatically, Arrays would serve you better.

#### Note

We have to use free() in C and delete in C++ to free the space used by deleted node, whereas, in Python and Java free space is collected automatically by garbage collector.
