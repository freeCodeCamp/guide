---
Sorry that you are stuck. Luckily there are many campers who hang out on Gitter and can help you resolve most issues! Follow these simple steps to get help fast:

1.  Go to the <a href='https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Help' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Help Room</a>
    *   If the problem is code related, paste the problematic code in the chat room with the <a href='http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/markdown-code-formatting/18391' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Proper Formatting</a> and a description of the issue.
    *   If the problem seems to be with the site itself, post a screenshot of the issue or describe it well.
2.  Remember that the people there are campers just like you, so be courteous!

3.  If your problem has baffled everyone in Gitter, try <a href='http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/searching-for-existing-issues-in-github/18390' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Searching for Your Issue on Github</a> for anyone who has posted about a similar issue.
