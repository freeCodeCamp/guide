An id selector is when you select an id from html in the css to make changes to it. To select an id you put a hashtag. 
It looks like this in the html: 
<p id="paragraph">This is a paragraph</p>

Then in the css if you want to change the style of that element you would add this: 

#paragraph {
  text-color:blue;
}

An id is unique to only one element.
