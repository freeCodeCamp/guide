## Typeface

A typeface is a design for a set of printer or display font(s), each for a set of characters, in a number of specific sizes. 

Typefaces often come as a family of typefaces, with individual typefaces for italic, bold, and other variations in the main design.

Readers shouldn't be confused and/or misunderstood the difference between a typeface and a font as both of these terms are widely used interchangably, though there is a subtle difference between the two.

A typeface is more of a type or family or category of a character that is printed or displayed on a page or the screen; whereas the font is more of a visual appearance or the display of that particular typeface.
