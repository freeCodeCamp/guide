## Linear Regression

![Linear Regression](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frossard/post/tensorflow/tf_linreg.gif)

Linear Regression is a linear approach for modeling data. Here, we model the relationship between a scalar variable `y` and one or more explanatory variables denoted by `X`.  
We model the relationship using functions with unknown parameters. 
We estimate the unknown model parameters from the data. 
We fit the model by minimising the squared error between the prediction and the output.
