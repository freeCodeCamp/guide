## HTML Entities

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
<p>Some characters are reserved in HTML to prevent the language to go wrong. In order to use those, there is an alternative called entities</p>

<p>As an example, if you use the great than symbol '>', it could be misunderstood by the browser resulting in bad syntax. That's why you would want to use &gt; instead.</p>

<p>The Entities syntax always starts with an '&' and ends with a semicolon ';'. In between comes letters or numbers.</p>
