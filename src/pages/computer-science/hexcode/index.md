## Hexcode 

A color hexcode describes the composition of a certain color in a specific color space, usually Red Green Blue (RGB). The first value pair refers to red, the second to green and the third to blue in hexadecimal 0 to FF (#RRGGBB). RGB is an additive color space, meaning that when all three colors are put together the result is white. For example, the color hex code for white is #FFFFFF and yellow is made up of red and green, so its hex code is #FFFF00. 

The codes can also be represented in a three-digit code to represent double values in CSS. For example, #FFFFFF can be abbreviated as #FFF. This only works under the "<style >" tag when used within HTML.
