## CPU

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) serves as the "brain" of a computer, allowing it to perform essential computational tasks.

CPUs are integrated circuits, which are complex circuits embedded on a single chip. They include registers, which store single values, and input/output pins. These pins allow them to talk to the rest of the computer. Oftentimes, CPUs will also contain more than one core, which allows them to multitask. 

CPU speeds are measured in gigahertz (GHz). For every gigahertz of speed, a CPU can perform one billion instructions in a second. These instructions are very simple, such as "add two numbers" or "move this variable to this location." To see this in action, read about <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language'>assembly language</a>.

Gigahertz is not the only determining factor in the actual speed of a processor, as different processors with the same gigahertz speed (also known as clock speed) may perform real-world tasks at different speeds due to using different sets of instructions to perform these tasks. These instruction sets are called CPU architectures.

Most modern CPUs use a 64-bit architecture, which means they store information as 64 binary 'bits'. Older CPUs used 32-bit, 16-bit, and even 8-bit architectures. The largest number a 64-bit CPU can store is 18,446,744,073,709,552,000.
