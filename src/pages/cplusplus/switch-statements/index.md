title:Switch Statement
---

A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each case.

Syntax:
switch(expression) {
   case constant-expression  :
      statement(s);
      break; //optional
   case constant-expression  :
      statement(s);
      break; //optional
  
   // you can have any number of case statements.
   default : //Optional
      statement(s);
}

The following rules apply to a switch statement âˆ’

The expression used in a switch statement must have an integral or enumerated type, or be of a class type in which the class has a single conversion function to an integral or enumerated type.

You can have any number of case statements within a switch. Each case is followed by the value to be compared to and a colon.

The constant-expression for a case must be the same data type as the variable in the switch, and it must be a constant or a literal.

When the variable being switched on is equal to a case, the statements following that case will execute until a break statement is reached.

When a break statement is reached, the switch terminates, and the flow of control jumps to the next line following the switch statement.

Not every case needs to contain a break. If no break appears, the flow of control will fall through to subsequent cases until a break is reached.

A switch statement can have an optional default case, which must appear at the end of the switch. The default case can be used for performing a task when none of the cases is true. No break is needed in the default case.

Example:
```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
   // local variable declaration:
   char grade = 'D';

   switch(grade) {
      case 'A' :
         cout << "Excellent!" << endl; 
         break;
      case 'B' :
      case 'C' :
         cout << "Well done" << endl;
         break;
      case 'D' :
         cout << "You passed" << endl;
         break;
      case 'F' :
         cout << "Better try again" << endl;
         break;
      default :
         cout << "Invalid grade" << endl;
   }
   cout << "Your grade is " << grade << endl;
 
   return 0;
}```

Output:
You passed
Your grade is D
