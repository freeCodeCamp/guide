## Converting Units Minutes to Hours

An hour consists of 60 minutes. Therefore, to convert the number of minutes into hours you divide by 60.

For example:

Say you spent 540 minutes coding for Hacktoberfest, and you want to tell people how many hours have passed. 

540 minutes * (1 hour/60 minutes) = (540/60) hours = 9 hours

You spent 9 hours coding for Hacktoberfest. Congratulations! :)
