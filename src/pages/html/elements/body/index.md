## Body
<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
The `<body>` tag contains the content for a webpage. Along with `<head>`, it is one of the two required elements of an HTML document. `<body>` must be the second child of an `<html>` element. There can only be one `<body>` element on a page.

The `<body>` element should contain all of a page's content, including all display elements. The `<body>` element can also contain `<script>` tagsâ€”generally, scripts that must be run after a page's content has been loaded.
  
  ```html
  <html>
  <head>
    <title>Document Titles Belong in the Head</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This paragraph is content. It goes in the body!</p>
  </body>
</html>
  ```
