## Paper Prototyping

Paper prototyping is a method widely used in user interface and user experience design. It involves in using the most traditional way which are pencil and papers. It is the most cost-efficient way to produce a visual graphic for mobile apps, websites or desktop apps. 

#### Brief Guide to Paper Prototyping
To begin, we must have a goal in mind for our prototype. Think of one before even beginning to do the prototyping, as with any other kind of prototyping. 
 
After deciding your goal, you can either choose to make personas or some storyboards as a quick draft.

Depending on what you are designing, be it a web application or a mobile app, choose your paper size - it should be of the same size as the screens you are going to implement in the future. This would be beneficial for you when you have to draw out your components and layout on paper. 

And of course, after you are done with one round of paper prototyping, take it for testing on users. The beauty of paper prototyping is that it's fast, efficient, and fun as well - you can make changes easily, and it's not too time-consuming to make edits too.

#### Advantages of Paper Prototyping
1. It's cost effective! What you would need is just pencil/pen and paper, without the need to engage in the services of a designer/developer to do up your prototypes.  

2. No design or programming involved at this stage. You don't need to utilize Photoshop, Sketch, etc in paper prototyping. Since all your designs will be hand drawn, you do not need fancy software or graphics to make a paper prototype. 

3. It allows for quick evaluation and testing. This is especially important when you are in an early stage of conceptualizing your idea, and any improvements or suggestions to the prototype can be easily made and discussed.
