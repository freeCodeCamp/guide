## Domain and Range of Quadratic Functions

Quadratic functions are functions of the type f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c where f(x) is a function of x and a, b and c are real numbers.

Quadratic functions are defined at all values of x, thus their domain is all real numbers.

Depending on the sign of the leading coefficient (a) then the function will either have one local maximum or one local minimum. Local maxima occur for values of a < 0 and local minima occur for values a > 0. The x value of the local maximum or minimum is given by the expression x = b/2a. Therefore, the range of a quadratic with a positive leading coefficient is y > f(b/2a) and for quadratics with a negative leading coefficient the range is given by y < f(b/2a).
