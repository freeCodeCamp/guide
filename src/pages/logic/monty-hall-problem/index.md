## Monty Hall Problem

The Monty Hall problem is a classic problem related to logic whose solution has suprised people for years, due to it's counter-intuitive nature. The problem originated from a game show *Let's make a deal* hosted by Monty Hall, from whom it got it's name.

The problem goes like this:

  1. There are three doors, behind two of which are goats and one of which is a car. You are asked to pick a door.
  2. The host (who knows what's behind which door) opens a door, other than the one you have picked, which has a goat behind it.
  3. Now you are asked to choose whether to stick to your door or switch.

You're probably thinking it doesn't matter much, as the probability of having a car behind the two closed doors are equal. 

You got it wrong!

**It's actually better to switch to the other door as it gives a higher chance of winning the car.**

Surprised?

You'll not be after you have read the rest.

Say, there are three doors A, B, and C. The probability of the car being behind the doors, is 1/3. Now you choose A (say). The host opens the door C with a goat behind it.

The probability for the car to be behind B or C (that is not behind A) is 2/3. Now with the door C revealed to have a goat, the probability for the car to behind the door B suddenly becomes 2/3. You can think of the event of opening door A, to cause a concentration of probability. 

*Thus switching becomes a better strategy for the game.*
