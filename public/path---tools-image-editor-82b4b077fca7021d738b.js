The following sections cover some of their differences.</p>\n<h3>Web App Image Editors</h3>\n<p>Web App Image Editors are available in-browser. In other words, you  do not need to leave your browser to work on an image. Example: the  ability to open images from a local folder/ url.</p>\n<h3>Open Source Editors</h3>\n<p>Available as free downloads and open to user contributions to the software’s development.</p>\n<h3>Paid Editors</h3>\n<p>Paid Editors need either a one-time payment or are subscription-based. But, trial-versions are available to test out the software before committing to buy. If you happen to be a student, many times, there are discounts  available through a student email or ID.</p>\n<h3>Links:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href='https://pixlr.com/editor/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Pixlr Editor</a> - Free | Browser</li>\n<li><a href='https://www.gimp.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Gimp</a> - Free | Download | Open-Source</li>\n<li><a href='https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Photoshop</a> - Free Trial | Paid</li>\n<li><a href='https://www.photoshop.com/products/photoshopexpress' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Photoshop Express</a> - Free | Mobile</li>\n</ul>",fields:{slug:"/tools/image-editor/"},frontmatter:{title:"Image Editor"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/tools/image-editor/"}}}});
