The MoSCoW method is a prioritization technique used in management, business analysis, project management, and software development to reach a common understanding with stakeholders on the importance they place on the delivery of each requirement - also known as MoSCoW prioritization or MoSCoW analysis.

The letters stand for:

* M: Must Have
* S: Should Have
* C: Could Have
* W: Won't have 

The reason MoSCoW is used is that the problem with simply saying that requirements are of High, Medium or Low importance is that the definitions of these priorities are missing. Using MoSCoW means that priorities are specific. The specific use of Must, Should, Could or Wonâ€™t Have implies the result of failing to deliver that requirement.
