# Operators

C# (C sharp) supports the use of various types of operators, including:
* Arithmetic Operators: `Attraction (+)`, `Subtraction (-)`, `Multiplication (*)`, `Division (/)`, `Modulus (%)`, `Increment (++)`, `Decrement (--)`
* Relational Operators: `Equal To (==)`, `Not Equal To (!=)`, `Greater Than (>)`, `Greater Than or Equal To (>=)`, `Less Than (<)`, `Less Than or Equal To (<=)`
* Logical Operators: `And (&&)`, `Or (||)`, `Not (!)`
* Assignment Operators: `Simple Assignment (=)`, `Add and Assign (+=)`, `Subtract and Assign (-=)`, `Multiply and Assign (*=)`, `Divide and Assign (/=)`, `Modulus and Assign (%=)`
