## Responsive Web Design

Responsive Web Design is Desiging approach for the web for diffrent screen Sizes, the Same codebase by using CSS Grids, Frameworks or more basically media queries.

There are 2 ways to make Webpages responsive.

#### 1. Media queries
```css
@media (query) {
  /* CSS Rules used when query matches */
}
```

##### 2. CSS Frameworks

by using CSS Frameworks, we can use CSS Classes pre built by the popular frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation to be used in the class attribute of our element like
```html
<div class="col-md-9 col-sm-6"></div>
```
In the above div on medium screen size devices, this div will be shown 9 out of 12 columns, while in small size devices will show this in 6 out of 12 columns. that's the beuty of reposive designing. What basically CSS Frameworks do is they provide Grid based design as in below image you can see grids of Bootstrap framework.
