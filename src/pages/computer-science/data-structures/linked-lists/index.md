## Linked Lists

Like arrays, linked lists is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored in contiguous locations, they are linked using pointers.

Why Linked Lists/ Advantages over Arrays?
1. Linked Lists are used at places where size is not fixed. The size of arrays is fixed, while defining an array we must know the maximum number of elements.

2. Ease of insertion/deletion. When an element is inserted in the beginning of an array, all the other elements are moved a location forward, while in linked lists only a node is added and a pointer changes.

Drawbacks:
1. Random access is not allowed.

2. Ends up taking more memory space, one pointer space extra for each element.
