## Symbols

Complementing the html entities, there are also representations for mathematical, technical and monetary symbols. There are entities even for playing cards suits.

### Mathematical

The sets theory symbols are very used, such as: `&isin;` (∈ - Element of) or `&notin;` (∉ - Not element of). Other common symbol is summation (∑): `&sum;`.

Mathematicians love Greek, and so there are also symbols for the Greek letters as Delta (Δ) - `&Delta;` and Gamma (Γ) - `&Gamma;`.

### Miscellaneous

Do you need arrows? Use the `&uarr;` - Upwards Arrow (↑). The black heart cards suit? There is the `&hearts;`. Playing chess? There is the white chess queen: `&#9813;` (♕).
