This section contains articles related to Mobile Hybrid Applications Development using frameworks such as Apache Cordova, Ionic Framework, and React Native.

### Apache Cordova

Apache Cordova is the wrapper that wraps your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a buildable mobile package, acting as the magic that glues everything together and turns it into a mobile app

### Ionic Framework

Ionic Framework is a CSS framework that allows you to style your screens to look mobile friendly, essentially acting as bootstrap but for mobile apps while developing using web technologies.

### React Native

React Native is a front end development framework that contains a lot of the building block elements for Android/iOS development and is a different kind of magic from Apache Cordova
