## Article

When writing in HTML, the `<article>` tag is a block element used to describe a section of content that is both self-contained and independent. More specifically, anything inside the `<article>` tag could be distributed separately from the rest of the site. Good examples are forum posts, blog posts and newspaper or magazine articles.


## Example
```html
<article>
  <h1>Google Chrome</h1>
  <p>Google Chrome is a free, open-source web browser developed by Google, released in 2008.</p>
</article>
```
