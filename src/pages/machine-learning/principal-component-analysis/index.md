Wikipedia Says, "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components (or sometimes, principal modes of variation)."

Principal component analysis(PCA) is a statistical technique used to examine the interrelations among a set of variables in order to identify the underlying structure of those variables. PCA usually reduces the number of features from N-Dimensional to k-Dimensional where k < N

PCA has following applications :
1) Compression
..* Increase the computational speed and also to reduce storage space
2) Visualization
..* PCA can reduce the data to two or three dimensional data for visualization purpose
