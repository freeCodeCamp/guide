## Accuracy and Precision
In measurement, it has two words to tell about measured values that are "accuracy" and "precision". Accuracy means how closeness between measured value and actual value. On the other hand, precision means how closeness between measured values from each other. For example, the <a href="https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?gn">standard gravity</a> `g` is defined as `9.806(65) m/s^2 `. If we do experiment to find the value of `g` then obtain a set of measured values as `9.801`, `9.810`, `9.799`, `9.821` and `9.806` , so we will call our values are accuracy not be precision. Whereas if we repeat the measurement and can get data: `8.256`, `8.257`, `8.256`, `8.255` and `8.255`, the our values are precision not be accuracy.
