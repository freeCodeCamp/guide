## CSS3 Backgrounds

The CSS background properties are:

* background-color
* background-image
* background-repeat
* background-attachment
* background-position

And the **CSS3** adds some **new background properties**, which are:

* background-size
* background-origin
* background-clip

Additionally, in the CSS3, the `background-image` property can be used to add **multiple background images**.

_It's important to highlight that browser support varies accordingly to the property and the browser version._
