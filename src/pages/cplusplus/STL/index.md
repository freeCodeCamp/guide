The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized. A working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite  for working with STL.

It is mostly used in the popular sport of competitive programming nowadays.

STL has four components:

Algorithms
Containers
Functions
Iterators
