We will create a new folder to house our example files (you may do this anywhere on your computer, and can use the command line or do this manually).</p>\\n<p>In the folder, we will create a file called <code>style.scss</code> and an HTML file to style called <code>index.html</code>:</p>\\n<p><em>The <code>tree</code> command in the image above is from an npm package you can install and is not native to the command line.

We type in the watch command on the file we want to watch:</p>\\n<p><code>sass --watch style.scss</code></p>\\n<p>The next step is to open up the project folder in your text editor of choice. Once we have our files opened and ready for editing, we can add in a very basic HTML page (for us to style) which will look like the following:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code><!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html lang=\\\"en\\\">\\n<head>\\n  <meta charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\">\\n  <title>Sass!</title>\\n  <link rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\" href=\\\"style.css\\\">\\n</head>\\n<body>\\n  <article>\\n    <h1>Hello World</h1>\\n    <p class=\\\"cat-paragraph-1\\\">Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, stand in front of the computer screen, so chase imaginary bugs has closed eyes but still sees you caticus cuteicus.</p>\\n    <p class=\\\"cat-paragraph-2\\\">Drink water out of the faucet chew on cable or if it fits, i sits roll on the floor purring your whiskers off.</p>\\n  </article>\\n</body>\\n</html></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>After setting up the HTML we can open up our <code>style.scss</code> file and begin styling in Sass. In the sample code below, you will probably notice how some the style selectors are nested within the article selector; something unique to Sass. Don’t fret, the syntax will be explained in Part 2.
