If you’re\nhosting your site another way, you’ll need to setup a custom rule to serve\nthis file for 404 errors.</p>\n<p>When developing, Gatsby adds a default 404 page that overrides your custom\n404 page. But you can still visit the exact url for your 404 page to verify\nit’s working as expected.</p>",
