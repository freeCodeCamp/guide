# Operators in C

## 1. Arithmetic Operators
- `+` Adds to operands (values) 
     ```C
     int a = 6;
     int c = a + 1; // c = 7
     ```
- `-`Subtracts the second operand from the first
     ```C
     int a = 8;
     int b = 9;
     int c = a - b; // c = -1
     ```
- `*` Multiplies two operands
     ```C
     int a = 8;
     int b = 9;
     int c = a * b; // c = 72
     ```
- `/` Divides the first operand by the second
     ```C
     int a = 8;
     int b = 4;
     int c = a / b; // c = 2
     ```
- `%` Gives the remainder after an integer division
     ```C
     int a = 8;
     int b = 9;
     int c = b % a; // c = 1 because b = 1*a + 1 = 8 + 1
     ```
- `++` Increases int value by one
     ```C
     int a = 8;
     a++; // a = 9
     int b = a++; // postfix operator; a = 10, b = 9
     int c = ++a; // prefix operator; a = 11, c = 11
     ```
- `--` Decreases int value by one
     ```C
     int a = 8;
     a--; // a = 7
     int b = a--; // postfix operator; a = 6, b = 7
     int c = --a; // prefix operator; a = 5, c = 5
     ```


## 2. Relational Operators

- `==` Equal - true when the two operands are equal
  ```C
  int a = 5, b = 5;
  bool c = (a == b); // c = true
  ```
- `!=` Not equal - true when the two operands are NOT equal
  ```C
  int a = 5, b = 6;
  bool c = (a != b); // c = true
  ```
- `>` Greater than - True when first operand is bigger than the second.
  ```C
  int a = 8, b = 5;
  bool c = (a > b); // c = true
  ```
- `<` Less than - True when the first operand is smaller then the second.
  ```C
  int a = 5, b = 8;
  bool c = (a < b); // c = true
  ```
- `>=` Greater than or equal - True when the first operand is bigger, or equal to the second.
  ```C
  int a = 8, b = 5;
  bool c = (a >= b); // c = true
  bool d = (a >= 8); // d = true
  ```
- `<=` Less than or equal - True when the first operand is smaller or equal to the second.
  ```C
  int a = 5, b = 8;
  bool c = (a <= b); // c = true
  ```

## 3. Logical Operators

- `&&` AND operator - True when **both** of the operands are true.
  ```C
  bool c = (5 < 6) && (8!=7); // both operands true, therefore c = true
  ```
- `||` OR operator - True when either the first or the second operands are true (or both)
  ```C
  bool c = (5 < 6) || (8 == 7) // first operand is true, therefore c = true
  ```
- `!` NOT operator - True when the operand is false. 
  ```C
  bool c = !(8 == 7) // translate: NOT (false), therefore c = true
  ```

## 4. Bitwise Operators

- `&` AND operator - If at a place there is a bit in both operands, then it is copied to the result
  ```C
  A = 11001
  B = 01000
  RESULT = 01000
  ```
- `|` OR operator - If at a place there is a bit in either operands, then it is copied to the result
  ```C
  A = 11001
  B = 01000
  RESULT = 11001
  ```
- `^` XOR (exclusive OR) operator - If at a place there is a bit in one of the operands (not both), then it is copied to the result
  ```C
  A = 11001
  B = 01000
  RESULT = 10001
  ```
- `~` Negation operator - Reverses the bits. 1 -> 0, 0 -> 1
  ```C
  C = 01000
  RESULT = 10111
  ```
- `<<` Left shift operator - The left operand is moved left by as many bits, as the right operand
  ```C
  A = 11001
     A << 2
  RESULT = 00100
  ```
- `>>` Right shift operator - The left operand is moved right by as many bits, as the right operand
  ```C
  A = 11001
     A >> 2
  RESULT = 00110
  ```

## 5. Assignment Operators
- `=`
  ```C
  int a = 7; // 'a' is going to be equal to 7
  ```
- `+=`
  ```C
  int a = 7;
  a += 5; // equivalent to a = a + 5 = 7 + 5 = 12
  ```
- `-=`
  ```C
  int a = 7;
  a -= 2; // equivalent to a = a - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5
  ```
- `*=`
  ```C
  int a = 7;
  a *= 3; // equivalent to a = a * 3 = 7 * 3 = 21
  ```
- `/=`
  ```C
  int a = 21;
  a /= 3; // equivalent to a = a / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7
  ```
- `%=`  
  ```C
  int a = 21;
  a %= 5; // equivalent to a = a % 5 = 21 % 5 = 1
  ```
     
## 6. Operator precedence in C
Operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the list. Within an expression, operators
with higher precedence will be evaluated first.
- Postfix `() [] -> . ++ --`
- Unary `+ - ! ~ ++ -- (type)* & sizeof`
- Multiplicative `* / %`
- Additive `+ -`
- Shift `<< >>`
- Relational `< <= > >=`
- Equality `== !=`
- Bitwise AND `&`
- Bitwise XOR `^`
- Bitwise OR `|`
- Logical AND `&&`
- Logical OR `||`
- Conditional `?:`
- Assignment `= += -= *= /= %= >>= <<= &= ^= |=`
- Comma `,`
