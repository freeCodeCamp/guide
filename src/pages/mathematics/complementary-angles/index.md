# Complementary Angles

## Definition

Two angles which (when added together) have a sum of 90&deg;, are called complementary angles.

Complementary angles don't have to be next to each other, just so long as the total is 90&deg;.

### For Example :

In the above figures, diagrams `a.` and `b.` show that the complementary angles are <i>adjacent</i>, whereas in `c.` and `d.`, the complementary angles are <i>not adjacent</i>.
