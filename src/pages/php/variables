## Variables In PHP?

Variables in PHP are case sensitive and must be prefixed with a $ sign. PHP is a loosely typed (or implicitly typed) 
language which means variables can be declared and used without requiring their type declared. 
PHP automatically casts the variable to the correct type when it is used. 
For example:

> $newNumber = 3; // would be an integer.
> $newWord = “Hello”; // would be a string. 

PHP does allow for types to be declared when required to avoid situations where 
you would want $newNumber to be a float and not an integer.
