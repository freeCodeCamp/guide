## Converting Between Radians and Degrees

### General Formulae

The following formulae can be used to convert between radians and degrees:
```
r = d * (π / 180)

d = r * (180 / π)

where r is the angle in radians and d is the angle in degrees.
```

### Examples

Convert 2π/3 radians to degrees:

```
2π/3 * 180/π = 360π/3π = 360/3 = 120 degrees
```

Convert 30 degrees to radians:

```
30 * π/180 = 30π/180 = π/6 or (1/6)π radians

Note: Radians are usually expressed in terms of π instead of a rounded decimal as this form represents the actual value rather than an approximation.
