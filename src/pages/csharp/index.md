## C#â€ƒ

C Sharp, more commonly referred to as "C#", is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. C# was developed by Anders Hejlsberg and his development team at Microsoft and is currently on version 7.0.

C# has its roots in the family of C languages. It inherits most of its features from C, C++, and Java. For this reason, programmers familiar with these languages may be able to get up to speed with C# in a shorter time span.

C# is an object-oriented language that provides support for component-oriented and functional programming.

#### Features of C# include:
1. Automatic Garbage Collection
2. Exception Handling
3. Type-safety
4. Versioning
5. Delegates
6. Properties
7. LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) and Lambda Expressions
8. Generics
9. Indexers
10. Multithreading

#### New Features Added in C# 7.0:
1. Deconstructors
2. New syntax to work with Tuples
3. Pattern Matching with Is Expressions
4. Local Functions
5. Return by Reference
6. Out Variables
7. Literal improvements
8. Generalized Async Return Types
9. More Expression-Bodied Members
10. Throw Expressions
11. Record Type
12. Minimizing OUT
13. Non-'NULL' able reference type

You can use C# to create Windows client applications, XML Web services, distributed components, client-server applications, database applications, and much more.

#### ASP.NET and .NET Applications
The C# language is also used with the ASP.NET framework, developed by Microsoft Corp., specifically for creating web applications that are machine and browser independent. The broader .NET framework, also developed by Microsoft, is used for creating other types of applications such as desktop, mobile, server, and networking applications. The .NET framework includes the .NET Base Class Libraries (BCL), ASP.NET, ADO.NET, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), and eXtensible Markup Language(XML) libraries.
