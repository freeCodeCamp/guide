### History
The concept families of type hadn't formed when typefaces were first invented, and all fonts were roman designs. During the early years of the 16th century, cursive type was introduced. Cursive was also called italic, named after Italy, where the idea was popularized. Romans were one style of type and italics were another, like serif and sans serif, and there were still no typeface families.

### Punctuation
Punctuation gives type emotion, and gives indications on when to stop, slow down, and much more.
