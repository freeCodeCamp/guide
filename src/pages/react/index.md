## React

By now, you probably know all about the backstory of React and how it helps even your most complex user interfaces sing performantly. For 
all the awesomeness that React brings to the table, getting started with it (kinda like this sentence) is not the most straightforward 
thing. It has a steep learning curve filled with many small and big hurdles:

In this tutorial, we are going to start at the very beginning and get our hands dirty by building a simple React app. We'll encounter some 
of these hurdles head-on, and some of these hurdles we'll skip over...for now. By the end of this tutorial, not only will we have built 
something you can proudly show off to your friends and family, we'll have set ourselves up nicely for diving deeper into all that React 
offers in future tutorials.
Onwards!
