 ## Hello World

To write on console you can use the function `printf()` contained in the library `include <stdio.h>`

 ```C
 #include <stdio.h>

 int main(void)
 {

     printf("hello, world\n");  //lines starting with this are called comments..

     return 0;
 }
 ```

 ## Output:
 ```
 >Hello World
 ```
