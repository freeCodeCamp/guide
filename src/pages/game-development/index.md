## Game Development

#### What Languages are Best for Game Development?
As a lower level language with Object-Oriented features, C++ is very popular for game development. One reason for this is that control over the size of vaiables is at the center of this language, and is an important feature for reducing memory waste.

Java is highly portable and very widely used, making it accesable to teams of programmers who may be farmiliar with few languages. 

While Python is very popular and often embedded into lower level languages such as Java or C++, it has a very high CPU overhead that may be too much for even the most powerful engines. 

Overall, the language being used depends on the type of game, the programmers who are creating it, and how much the game requires of a typical CPU. There is no language that is best for all games, but a farmiliarity with the languages that are will help determine which is best for any particular game.
