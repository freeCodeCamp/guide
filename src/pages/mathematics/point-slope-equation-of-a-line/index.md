## Point Slope Equation of a Line

Point-slope is the general form y-y₁=m(x-x₁) for linear equations. 

It emphasizes the slope of the line and a point on the line (that is not the y-intercept).

## Derivation

Any two points on a line A(x,y) and B(x₁,y₁) will always be on the same slope. A is assumed to be an arbitrary point on the same line.
'm' is defined as the slope of the line and the tangent of the angle the line makes with the positive x-axis.
Slope of a line between two points is given by:

m   =   (y - y₁) / (x - x₁) 

for this case, where m is the slope of the line
simplifying we get 
y-y₁=m(x-x₁)
