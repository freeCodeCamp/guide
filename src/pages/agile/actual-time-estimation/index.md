## Actual Time Estimation

Actual time estimation is a time-based method of estimating development work.  

It is critically important to be able to estimate the time-to-completion of an Agile project, unfortunately, it is also one of the most difficult parts of planning an Agile project. 

Its intent is to best approximate the amount of time required to complete a given development task. 

One technique you may use is to estimate the time it will take to complete user stories. When you are doing this, remember to consult with other members of your agile team. For each user story, make sure that you estimate a time that is realistic and feasible, yet not so much that the client is overcharged for simple work. Consult members of your team so that you may be able to leverage their expertise to be able to understand how much work is required and how long it will take. When you have a consensus for each user story, you can add up the times to come up with a time estimation. 

As the requirements of the project change over time, you can update the estimate. If a project loses some resources originally allocated to it, you may need to cut user stories to be able to complete them in the same amount of total time. Similarly, if you want to improve the quality of the app, you may need to allocate more time to each user story to make sure your team has time to finish the app with the desired quality.

Generally, these estimates are calculated using ideal engineering hours.

Examples: 

**This task will be complete in 10 days.**

Or… 

**This task will be complete by January 10th.**

Or… 

**This task will require 25 development hours for completion.**
