Arrays are variables that can store multiple values of the same type using the [] operator.

Example:
int sample[3]
 - int is the data type
 - sample is the name of the array
 - 3 is the size declarator; number of elements in the array
 
 
 Example of working array:
 //This is to obtain the number of hours worked for 5 total days.
 
 
 int main()
 {
 const int NUM_DAYS = 5;
 int hoursWorked[NUM_DAYS];
 
 //Get the number of hours worked each days.
 cout << "Enter the number of hours worked:";
 cin >> hoursWorked[0];
 cin >> hoursWorked[1];
 cin >> hoursWorked[2];
 cin >> hoursWorked[3];
 cin >> hoursWorked[4];
 return 0;
 }
 
 This program will record the number of hours worked on each assigned day.
