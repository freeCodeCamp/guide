## Orthogonality

Orthogonality is a software design principle for writing components in a way that changing one component doesn't affect other components. It is the combination of two other principles, namely strong cohesion and loose coupling.

### Strong Cohesion

Inside a software component, code should be strongly connected. This is an indication that the code is correctly divided. If a component had two or more relatively disconnected parts, that may indicate that those parts should be in a different component, or on it's own.

### Loose Coupling

Between software components, there should be few connections. If two components are strongly coupled, it may indicate that they need to be one component, or that they need to be differently divided into more components.
