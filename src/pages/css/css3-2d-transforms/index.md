## CSS3 2d Transforms


CSS3 transforms allow you to translate, rotate, scale, and skew elements.
A transformation is an effect that lets an element change shape, size and position.
CSS3 supports 2D and 3D transformations.

These are a few 2D transformation methods:

translate()
rotate()
scale()
skewX()
skewY()
matrix()

### Here is a small introduction on each of these methods:

matrix(n,n,n,n,n,n)
Defines a 2D transformation, using a matrix of six values

translate(x,y)	
Defines a 2D translation, moving the element along the X- and the Y-axis

translateX(n)	
Defines a 2D translation, moving the element along the X-axis

translateY(n)	
Defines a 2D translation, moving the element along the Y-axis

scale(x,y)	
Defines a 2D scale transformation, changing the elements width and height

scaleX(n)	
Defines a 2D scale transformation, changing the element's width

scaleY(n)	
Defines a 2D scale transformation, changing the element's height

rotate(angle)	
Defines a 2D rotation, the angle is specified in the parameter

skew(x-angle,y-angle)	
Defines a 2D skew transformation along the X- and the Y-axis

skewX(angle)	
Defines a 2D skew transformation along the X-axis

skewY(angle)	
Defines a 2D skew transformation along the Y-axis
