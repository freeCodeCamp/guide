## Adjust the Padding of an Element

Padding is the spacing between the content and the border of an Element.

  •There is spacing from the top, bottom, left, and right. 

  •The spacing is a numerical value that increases or decreases by units of pixels that is written as `px`.

To adjust the Padding of an Element, use:
```css
padding: 10px;
```

To create Padding as a class for a specific Element, use:
```css
.example-Padding {
  padding: 10px
{
```
To apply this class to the appropriate field, use:
```html
<div class="example-Padding">
<p> Example Text </p>
</div>
```
<b>To Adjust the Padding of an Element</b>, use:

padding: `10`px;

  Now modify the numerical value to the desired amount.
  
padding: `50`px;
