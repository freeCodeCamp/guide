## Where To

**The <script> Tag**

In HTML, JavaScript code must be inserted between <script> and </script> tags.

```
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>
```


**JavaScript Functions and Events**

A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.

For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.


**JavaScript in head or body**

You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.

Scripts can be placed in the body, or in the head section of an HTML page, or in both.
