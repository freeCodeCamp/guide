## Business Value

<b>In Agile software development:</b>

One of the principles of Agile is to always deliver value to the customer. When it comes to software development, it can easily get out of focus in the maintenance, code quality and test tasks to actually deliver business value to the customer. 

One way of ensuring this is always done was the correct user story creation. As a Developer, I want to add this feature to deliver this value. 

Some agile teams implement a column on their story descriptions to highlight what business value this feature delivers to the customer or what problem it solves.

<b>In Management:</b>

Business value is an informal term that includes all forms of value that determine the health and well-being of the firm in the long run.
