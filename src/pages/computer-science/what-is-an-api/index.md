## What is an API

## Introduction

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a software application interface, consisting of functions and procedures, for software to access data over remote end-points. These end-points may be servers or even other applications from which specific data made available can be acquired or sent to. 

## How do APIs actually work holistically:

Let's say you have a mobile app that needs to interact with various websites, all built in different programming languages and on different platforms. An API will allow you to seamlessly connect to and retrieve or send information to these different websites with a tap of a button. In this example, the API works like a one-size-fits-all universal-plug that standardizes access to data.

## Examples of real-world APIs:

- Amazon has an API that allows remote website's, not directly affiliated with Amazon.com, to update products directly on Amazon.com.
- Cars that interact with users come with a host of built-in APIs to facilitate the user experience. An example would be data on your cars current fuel economy and even fuel cost.
- Samsung Smart Home, which allows users access and control over their household appliances, are built on the foundation of APIs in order to collect and push data.
- Ever seen Google Maps on someone's website? That's an API!
