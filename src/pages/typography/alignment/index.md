## Alignment
There are 4 types of alignments:
-Justified algnment
-Left Justified alignment(also called Flush left alignment)
-Right Justified alignment(also called Flush right alignment)
-Centered alignment

JUSTIFIED ALIGNMENT:
      Justified alignment is a very popular choice as many people prefer the neat, straight edge appearance on both sides of the paragraph. However, to create the straight edges on each side of the paragraph requires the words to be unevenly spaced and this is where the main issue lies. When a line within a paragraph contains a number of large words, gaps of white space can appear. Furthermore, when these gaps appear over multiple lines we get what is described as “white rivers” running through the entire paragraph. Not only are these unsightly, they hinder readability.Rivers can be minimised in a number of ways. 
      
LEFT JUSTIFIED ALIGNMENT:
      With this alignment, the left side of the paragraph is straight (or flush) and the right side is called ragged. The great thing about this alignment is that the word spacing is even and rivers are eliminated.This alignment is great for narrow columns.
      
RIGHT JUSTIFIED ALIGNMENT:
      This is opposite to the flush left alignment as the ragged edge appears on the left side of the paragraph and the straight (flush) edge on the right. However, this alignment is demanding to read as the reader is continually searching for the beginning of each line as this varies throughout the paragraph due to the ragged edge. It should therefore only be used for short amounts of copy such as image captions.
     
CENTERED ALIGNMENT:
       This alignment gives the type a look of dignity but the line length should be varied to create a pleasing and interesting silhouette—no two lines should be the same, or close to the same length. Centred text should only be used for short amounts of copy such as poems or invitations, as like flush right alignment, it is demanding to read due to the variations in line length. The lines should be broken in a way that makes sense in relation to the content and generous line spacing is also required.
      
JUSTIFICATION OF HEADLINES:
      Titles and headings over left-justified body text should also be flush left. Centered headings pair well with justified text, but justified text should not be used on Web pages. Centered display type contrasts with the asymmetry of the ragged right margin of left-justified body text and produces an unbalanced page.
