## Converting Units Minutes to Hours

A minute is defined as one sixtieth of an hour. Conversion between minutes and hours is thus given by

<pre><code>t<sub>h</sub> = t<sub>min</sub> / 60

t<sub>min</sub> = t<sub>h</sub> * 60
</code></pre>

where t<sub>min</sub> is the time in minutes and t<sub>h</sub> is the time in hours.

The symbols for time in minutes and hours are **min** and **h** respectively (The International System of Units, 8th edition, [Chapter 4: Units outside the SI](https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf)).

### Examples

Converting from time in minutes to time in hours:

```
90 minutes = (90 / 60) hours = 1.5 hours
```

Converting from time in hours to time in minutes:

```
24 hours = (24 * 60) minutes = 1440 minutes
```
