The id selector can be used to override the class selector which is more general. id has a higher priority than class, therefore its rules apply if a conflict occurs.
If for example you want to attribute the color "red" to a paragraph, you can use the following code to do so:

<p id="name"> Paragraph </p> 
and in the style section it the following code can be used:
#name
{
 color:red;
}

Using the "id" selector is very simple and useful, therefore it is highly encouraged to use it.
