## Create a Stateless Functional Component

### Hint 1

- Stateless functions are one of the ways to create a React component.
- These functions can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data.
- To make the componenent, a stateless component, a return function is one of the necessary things and that's what is missing

### Hint 2

A return function is added like this
````jsx
return(
    <return elements>
);
````

### Solution

````jsx
return(
    <div>Completed challenge!</div>
);
  ````
