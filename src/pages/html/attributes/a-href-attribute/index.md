## A Href Attribute

The `<a href>` atrribute refers to a destination provided by a link. The `a` tag is dead without `<href>`. It's useful to work without a link because which is not neccesary at the moment, so what we do is to put instead a link, the `#` to kill the hyperlink.

For instance:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Href Attribute Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/contribute/">The freeCodeCamp Contribution Page</a>shows you how and where you can contribute to freeCodeCamp's community and growth.
      </p>
  </body>
</html>
```
The `<a href>` attributes is supported by all browsers.

### Examples
```html
<a href="#">Link dead</a>
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a>
```
