## Font Weight and Style

font weight and font styling are css properties for text, headings etc. for making them diffrent than other text. 

### MDN Definitions:


The **font-weight** CSS property specifies the weight (or boldness) of the font. The font weights available to you will depend on the font-family you are using. Some fonts are only available in normal and bold.

The **font-style** CSS property specifies whether a font should be styled with a normal, italic, or oblique face from its font-family.

Basically font-weight is like making font bold or normal like we do in normal text editors, or font style is like making them italic, strikethrough etc. in basic text editors like microsoft word.
