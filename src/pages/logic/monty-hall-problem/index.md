## Monty Hall Problem

The Monty Hall Problem describes a game situation in which the player chooses one of three hidden options. One of these options is a winner and the other two are losers. Once the player makes a selection, one of the other options is shown to be a loser.

Then the player has the option of changing their selection.

So the problem is: should the player change their selection?

In short, the answer is yes.
