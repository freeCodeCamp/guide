title: C++ If Statement

# The IF statement.

**What does an if statement do?**

* The `if` statement evaluates the test expression present inside the parenthesis.
* The `if` statement uses relational and logical operators to make logical expressions.

  -----------------------------------------------
  The general form of `if` statement:

```cpp
  if (Test Expression / Condition)
  {
    // Block of statements if test expression is True
  }
```

If the value of the test expression is **true**, then the block of
code inside the if statement is executed.

If the value of the test expression is **false**, then the block of
code inside the if statement is skipped and your code continues.

Example `if` statement:

```cpp
  int a = 10;
  
  // true statement
  if (a < 20)
  {
    // execute this block of code
  }

  // false statement
  if (a < 0)
  {
    // Skip this block of code.
  }
```


Example In C++ :

```cpp
  // Program to check if number entered by the user is positive
  // If negative, the block of code is skipped

  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
  {
    int no ;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> no;

    // if statement to check if the number is positive
    if ( no > 0)
    {
      cout << "You have entered a positive number: " << no << endl;
    }

    // If number is not positive, then if statement is skipped a program continues
    cout << "This step is always printed" << endl;

    return 0;
  }
```


**Output:**

OUTPUT 1:

```
Enter a number: 5
You have entered a positive number: 5
This step is always printed 
 ```
This is the output when the number entered is positive.

OUTPUT 2:

```
Enter a number:  -1
This step is always printed
```
This is the output when the number entered is negative.
