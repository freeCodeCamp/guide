title: Jenkins

Jenkins is an open source automation server which allow developers to automate their development processes such as testing, merging pull requests, and deploying applications. 

Developers are able to create plugins through Jenkins that can be used by others. For example, a developer might create a plugin that automates comparing pull requests to a master branch and checking that nothing breaks and then merging the pull request. Another user can then adopt that plugin in order to add that automation to their work flow.
