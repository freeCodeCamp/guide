## Truth Tables

A truth table is a mathematical tool used in Boolean Algebra. It consists of a column each for the function variables. A final column holds the functional value evaluated for the corresponding values of the variables. For a boolean function of n varibles, its truth table expansion will have 2^n rows. This is beacuse each varaible has two possible states – true & false.

Let us explore the truth table for the AND operator :

| x | y | x AND y  |
|---|---|---|
| F  | F  | F  |
| F  | T  | F  |
| T  | F  | F  |
| T  | T  | T  |

AND is binary operator. It operates on two variables, say `x`, `y`. 

Thus we have 2^2 = 4 columns in our truth table !

The last column is the functional value – x AND y.

Truth tables are a powerful tool. They can be used to express & evaluate simple boolean functions and operations as well complex combinational circuits and sequential logic circuits !
