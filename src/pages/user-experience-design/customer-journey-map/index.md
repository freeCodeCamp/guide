## Customer Journey Map

A customer journey map explains the potential trayectory of the customer’s experience: from initial contact, through the process of engagement and into a long-term relationship.
It may focus on a particular part of the trayectory or give an overview of the entire experience. What it always does is identify key interactions that the customer has with the organization. It talks about the user’s feelings, motivations and questions for each of these touchpoints.
It often provides a sense of the customer’s greater motivation. What do they wish to achieve, and what are their expectations of the organization?
A customer journey map takes many forms but typically appears as some type of infographics. Whatever its form, the goal is the same: to teach organizations more about their customers.
