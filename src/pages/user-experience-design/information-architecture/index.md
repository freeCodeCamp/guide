## Information Architecture

## What is Information Architecture? 

Information Architecture, also known as IA in the field of User Experience Design, is about creating a content specific structure of any digital system such as website, an app, or a software system. 

Information Architecture can be achieved by creating content strategies, navigation or content hierarchy or simply categorization of the information to be put on a website, application, or the project. The goal of Information Architecture is to simply provide the users of the system a sense of understanding in terms of where they are on a particular system and thus helps them understand their surroundings so that they can find the information that theyâ€™re looking for.

Whether we are accessing a site maps, hierarchies, a navigation/menu, or categories on the website, we are interacting with the Information Architecture of that particular website or application or project.

In simplest words, 

"Information Architecture is the flow of information on your website or on your system that you use to direct your users to make them achieve their goals."

For Example, for an eCommerce website, the information architecture would be its products categories and site navigation (menu) that directs and navigates a user from its home page to the checkout page through search or product pages and thus helps the user achieve their goal of buying a product from that specific website.
