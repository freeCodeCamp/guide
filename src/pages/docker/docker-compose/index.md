## Docker compose

Docker-Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services.

```
1)create a Dockerfile which defines the image and can be produsable every where.
```
```
2)create a docke-compose yml file to run the services
```
```
3)use docker-compose up to start the sevices specified in docker-compose.yml file
```
