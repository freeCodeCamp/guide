## Doctype

HTML code is always accompanied by it's "boilerplate" of tags. The very first tag found on any HTML file will be <!DOCTYPE html>. 

This tag ensures that the browser will try and follow any specifications that you have stated after the opening tag. 
This means that the browser will know how to render your file - instead of using a method of rending that could be incompatible with your code.
