When two variables are correlated it means that changes to one variable tend to predict changes in another variable to a certain degree of certainty, e.g. if the value of X increases then Y also increases.

It is a logical fallacy to assume that the increase in X is causing the increase in Y. This becoems more clear when trying to draw conclusions about a correlated relationship:
  
  As more people cycle to work carbon emissions are seen to decrease.

In this example the number of people cycling (X) is correlated (negative correlation is where increase in one variable predicts a decrease in another) with carbon emissions (Y), but it cannot be said that the decrease in carbon emission was caused by the increase in cyclists. The assumption is that an increase in cyclists leads to a decrease in cars which causes a decrease in carbon emissions. This is also faulty logic. Having more cyclists does not necessarily lead to fewer cars. It is possible to have both more cyclists and more cars.  

This shows a negative correlation between the number of people riding bicycles (X) and carbon emissions (Y). An increase in
