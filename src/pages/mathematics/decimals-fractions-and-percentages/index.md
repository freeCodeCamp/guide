## Decimals Fractions and Percentages

Decimals, Fractions and Percentages are different denotions of representing "parts of a whole".

Let us start with real world examples:

3.5 times the size
2/3 of a pizza
20% Profit

Notice one thing in the above examples: They all represent some quantities as parts of a whole.

### Converting Decimals, Fractions and Percentages

#### Percent to Decimal

To convert from a percent to a decimal, just move the decimal point two positions to the left and discard the percent symbol:

e.g. 25% becomes 0.25
e.g. 5% becomes 0.05
e.g. 34.23% becomes 0.3423

#### Percent to Fraction

Remember that percent is `per cent` meaning `per hundred`. So, to convert from percent to fraction put the mentioned figure in percent over 100 and discard the percent symbol and then simply the resulting fraction if possible:

e.g. 55% becomes 55/100 which equals 11/20
e.g. 75% becomes 75/100 which equals 3/4

#### Decimal to Percent

To convert from a decimal to percent, just move the decimal point two positions to the right and add the percent symbol:

e.g. 0.25 becomes 25%
e.g. 0.05 becomes 5%
e.g. 0.3423 becomes 34.23%

#### Decimal to Fraction

To convert from a decimal to a fraction, keep in mind that the first digit to the right of decimal point is the tenths digit, and so on & first digit to the left of decimal point is the units digit and so on. Consider the number 137.634

| 1             | 3             | 7               |.               |6                | 3               |  4              |
| :-----------: |:-------------:| :-------------: |:-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Hundreds      | Tens          |  Units          |                | Tenths          | Hunderdeths     | Thousandths     |

The number of zeroes in the denominator should match the number of digits in the decimal(don't include a possible 0 in front of the decimal point):

e.g. 0.4 is four-tenths which equals 4/10
e.g. 0.34 is thirty four hundreds which equals 34/100
e.g. 0.009 is 9 thousandths which equals 9/1000

#### Fraction to Decimal

To convert from a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by denominator:

e.g. 5/8 is 5 divided by 8 which equals 0.625
e.g. 3/4 is 3 divided by 4 which equals 0.75


#### Fraction to Percent

To convert from a fraction to a perent, first convert the fraction into a decimal and the resulatant decimal into a percent using the steps mentioned above:

e.g. 1/2 is 0.50 which equals 50%
e.g. 4/5 is 0.80 which equals 80%
