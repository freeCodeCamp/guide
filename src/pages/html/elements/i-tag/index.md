## I Tag

The `<i>` tag is usually used to mark a word in a text, that is somehow different from the rest for some reason, such as if it represents technical phrase, slang word or foreign language word. By default, browser render text marked by `<i>` in _italics_. 

Use this tag with care and only when you can not use more specific sematic tags such as:

 - `<em>` (emphasized text)
 - `<strong>` (important text)
 - `<mark>` (marked/highlighted text)
 - `<cite>` (the title of a work)
 - `<dfn>` (a definition term)

#### Example

```html
<p>The phrase <i>no work done, no pies to eat</i> is a traditional Czech saying...</p>
```
