title: Increment a Number with JavaScript

You can easily increment or add `1` to a variable with the `++` operator.

    i++;

is the equivalent of

    i = i + 1;

**Note** The entire line becomes `i++;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

We can perform postfix increment (x++) which returns a value before incrementing or prefix increment (++x) which returns a value after incrementing.
```
 // Postfix 
 var x = 3;
 y = x++; // y = 3, x = 4
 
 // Prefix
 var a = 2;
 b = ++a; // a = 3, b = 3
 ```
