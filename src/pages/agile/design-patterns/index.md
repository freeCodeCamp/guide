## Design Patterns

Design Patterns describe simple and elegant solutions to specific problems in object-oriented software design.

Commonly, these patterns have been developed and evolved over time, while better solutions to known problems are being used in the software development industry.

The book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by the Gang of Four, was the first book to try to catalog the most well-known patterns from that time in an easy way for developers to put to use into their projects.

Some patterns have been so crucial to the industry that became part of technologies, like Iterator in C++, Java, and other languages, or Observer, commonly used into Reactive Programming.
