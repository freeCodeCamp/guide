## Font Color Attribute

How can we change the font color in our HTML tags? We can use **hex numbers**
```HTML
<font color="#ff0000">text</font>
```

You could also use **name of colors**:
```HTML
<font color="red">Hello!</font>
```

Or ***rgb numbers***
```HTML
<font color="rgb(255,0,0)">Your text!</font>
```
