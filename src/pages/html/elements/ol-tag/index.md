## Ol Tag

The `<ol>` tag is used to represent an ordered set of items and it typically renders each item with either a letter or number associated with it.

A simple example of an ordered list:

```html
<ol>
  <li>First</li>
  <li>Second</li>
  <li>Third</li>
</ol>
```

The above example would render the following in the browser:

1. First
2. Second
3. Third
