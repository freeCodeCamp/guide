title: Supervised Learning
---
In supervised learning, we know what the correct output should be. Supervised learning problems can be categorized into regression and classification. A regression problem is where you map input to a continuous output. A classification problem, in contrast, is where you map (group) inputs into discrete categories.

### Regression

Given data about used cars such as their mileage, you can predict their market prices. Since price is a continuous variable, this is a regression problem. In another example, Microsoft released a web app that predicts age based on picture. Again, as age is continuous rather than discrete or categorical, this is a regression problem.  

### Classification

The regression problems above can be turned into classification problems. Suppose you want to look for a used car less than X dollars. Then the output would be if the used car fits the price that you set. Similarly, age prediction can be a classification problem if we are looking to predict if a submitted picture belongs to someone under 18, and therefore should not be allowed to buy cigarettes.

Discussion points:

- Supervised learning is task when you have a response you're trying to predict
- Ideas of training data to use
- Use test data to test learning from training data
- Think about complexity of learning model
- Should validate your learning with methods such as cross-validation
- Should be wary of overfitting
- Give examples e.g. logistic regression, support vector machines, neural networks

Takeaway points:

- What is special about supervised learning?
- In what scenario would you use it in?
- Caveats or traps to think about?
- What are some example models?
