## Sprints

In Scrum, the **Sprint** is a timebox; a period of working time, usually between one and four weeks. The Delivery Team works on your project over consecutive Sprints.

Your Sprints should remain the same length of time throughout the length of the project. 

The Sprint is usually kicked off each time with the Sprint Planning sessions, and ends with the Sprint Review and Retrospective meetings.

Your team works to break up the User Stories to a size that can be completed within the duration of the Sprint without carrying over to the next. And having short sprints allows regular feedback loops between the Stakeholders on the output from the Delivery Team.

"Sprint" and "Iteration" are often used interchangeably.
