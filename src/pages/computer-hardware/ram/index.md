## RAM

RAM stands for random-access memory, alternatively referred to as **main memory**, **primary memory**, or **system memory** is a computer hardware where the data that your computer is currently working on is stored.<br/>
Unlike hard drives RAM is a volatile memory and requires power to keep the data accessible. If the computer is turned off, all data contained in RAM is lost. New users often confuse RAM with disk drive space. See <a href='https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/memory.htm' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>memory</a> definition for a comparison between memory and storage.<br/>

#### Types of RAM:
Over the evolution of the computer there have been different variations of RAM. Some of the more common examples are DIMM, RIMM, SIMM, SO-DIMM, and SOO-RIMM. Below is an example image of a 512 MB DIMM computer memory module, a typical piece of RAM found in desktop computers. This memory module would be installed into one of the memory slots on a motherboard.

#### RAM speeds:
The speed rating of your RAM module is an expression of its data transfer rate. The faster the number, the faster your computer can store and retrieve the data stored in local memory. The formula for the exact speed rating changes slightly based on the version of DDR memory your computer is using. It’s no longer simply an expression of clock speed, like a processor, but a combination of hardware factors. But in general, faster is better.
