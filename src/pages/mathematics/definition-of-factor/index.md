## Definition of Factor

Factors are two numbers that we can multiply together to yield another number. 
For example, 2 * 10 = 20, so 2 and 10 are factors of 20. 

Often in algebra, we want to factor out expressions.
Take, (x^2 + 4x +3), in the form Ax^2+Bx+C
in order to factor this by looking for two numbers that will multiply to equal C and add up to equal C.
3 and 4 add up to 4 and multiply to equal 3. 

With this in mind, (x^2 + 4x +3) can be factored out into (x+3)(x+1).
