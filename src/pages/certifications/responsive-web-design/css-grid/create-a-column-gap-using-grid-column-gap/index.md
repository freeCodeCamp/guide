## Create a Column Gap Using grid-column-gap

This challenge requires you to add a gap of 20px between all the columns of the CSS Grid in .container.

### Hint

To add the gap between the columns of a grid, we use:

````css
grid-column-gap: parameter;
```` 

where parameter is the required gap.

### Solution

Since the challenge has you adding a gap of 20px, you would add the following line to the .container CSS codeblock.

````css
grid-column-gap: 20px;
````
