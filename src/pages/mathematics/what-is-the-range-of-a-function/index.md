## What Is the Range of a Function
<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->

The range of a function is the complete set of all possible resulting values of the dependent variable, after you substitute the domain. In other words, the range is the resulting y-values you get after substituting all the possible x-values.

For example, for <span class='texhtml'>y = sqrt(x + 2)</span>, the range of this function is <span class='texhtml'>y >= 0</span>.
