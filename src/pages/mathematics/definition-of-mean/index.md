## Definition of Mean

The mean of a set of numbers is the average. You calculate the mean by adding all the numbers together and then dividing by how many numbers are in the set. In other words, the mean is the sum divided by the count.

```
Example:  

5, 3.2, -7, 9.1, 8

sum = 5 + 3.2 + (-7) + 9.1 + 8 = 18.3

count = 5

mean = 18.3 / 5 = 3.66
```
