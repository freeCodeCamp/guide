## Percentage Difference
The difference between two values divided by the average of the two values. Shown as a percentage.

Difference means to subtract one value from another:

Example: Alex sold 15 tickets, and Sam sold 25
         The difference between 25 and 15 is: 25 − 15 = 10

Average is the value halfway between:

       average =  (first value + second value)/2 

Example continued:

        The average of 25 and 15 is: (25 + 15) / 2 = 40/2 = 20
        And then the difference as a Percentage of the average:

Example continued:

        Difference is 25 − 15 = 10
        Average is (25 + 15) / 2 = 20
        
        10 as a percentage of 20 is:
        10/20  × 100% = 50%

        The percentage difference between 25 and 15 is 50%

Here is the answer, in one line:

        Example continued
        (25 − 15)/((25 + 15)/2)  × 100% = 50%
