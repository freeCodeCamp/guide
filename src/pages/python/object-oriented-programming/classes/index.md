## Classes

A Class is a "blueprint" for creating objects: writing a class permits to describe attributes and behaviors commons to every instance of this class. 

## Create a Class

To define a class the keyword **class** is used, followed by the name defining the class and a colon. All the following lines (code describing attributes and behaviors/methods) - are indented as in a Python function. For example, to create a class named Person, we can write:

`class Person:
   <code describing attributes and behaviors/methods> `

Class definitions must be executed before they have any effect.
