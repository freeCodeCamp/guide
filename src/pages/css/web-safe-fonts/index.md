The use of web safe fonts in CSS is extremely important to ensure there are no compatibility issues between your browser and operating system.  If you don't account for this, then your web page may be hard to view by web surfers or just plain unreadable.  Adding web safe fonts to your CSS allows the browser to cycle through your list and then uses the first one that is supported.  For example, say you choose Andale Mono as the main font and also include a few web safe fonts like Times New Roman and Arial; then if someone using an incompatible Windows system went to your site, they would still have a good experience because their browser would implement one of the two web safe fonts.

Some common web safe fonts:

- Arial
- Helvetica
- Times
- Times New Roman
- Courier
- Courier New
