## Customer Journey Maps

### What Is Customer journey map?

Customer journey mapping is a tool to map out the entire user story as a whole - from the initial contact, usage until the abandonment of the service. 

### How Does It Look Like?

The customer journey maps can have many forms and usually consist of a description of userâ€™s needs, feelings, motivations, touchpoints (eg. e-mail, customer care phone line, various devices etc.), interactions and the team members responsible for solution within those interactions.

### How To Create One? 

The building of such map starts with thorough user research - both quantitative and qualitative and then maps it to the desired outcomes of the service. 

### Why Do We Need It?

It helps the team building or maintaining a service, application or website to see the context of the whole experience in one place. It also helps to identify weak points and opportunities of the process. The main reason for creating such map is to stay focused on the user and not on technical, organisational or other aspects of building the service.
