## A B Testing

A/B testing, is also known as split-testing or bucket testing. It compares two variants of a page to determine which variant do users prefer, or perform better for a given goal.

### Understanding A B Testing with an Example

For instance, you as a blogger wishes to increase the orders of your books. Your current website advertisement pops up in the center of your article. You want to do better.

You think a new version will increase the likelihood of them purchasing your books. 

The first version, also termed the "control", is the current version. The second version, termed the "variant", is to have the advertisement pop up at the end of your article page. With these two versions, you have created two variants of a page. 

You then release these 2 different pages to different groups of people. For instance, the people from Asia will only see the first version. The people from Europe will only see the second version. 

You measure their engagement for a period and then follow to analyze the data. It shows the following results for both pages. First version has a positive effect on the likelihood of them purchasing your books. Second version has no effect on the likelihood of them purchasing your books. This is an example of A B Testing.

### What it means in UX Design

A B Testing enables data-informed decisions and provides evidence. It can show that a variant performs better for a given conversion goal.

One of the greatest difficulty for A B Testing is the conversion goal. If your goals are less easy to measure, pure A B Testing won't provide those answers. 

It should not be the total solution. 

A better approach would be to use some form of usability testing to understand the users' frustrations and issues. Then use A B Testing to test the different solutions.
