## Create a Stateless Functional Component

- Stateless functions are the first way to create a React component.
- These functions can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data.

## Hint 1:

- Your function must return a jSX wich contains a "div" tag within a child "b or i etc.".
- Remember to close all tags.  
  
## Solution
```javascript
 const MyComponent = function() {
  // change code below this line
    return (
      <div>
      <b>text</b>
      </div>
    );
  // change code above this line
}
```
