## Upper and Lower Case

Many languages have two different written representations of their letters, **upper case** and **lower case**, also known as majuscule and minuscule forms. 

Upper case and lower case letters are often mixed in the same piece of text. The use of cases is decided by grammar, but a variety of [case styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Case_styles) also exists. 
Certain case styles are common in computer programming, referred to as [naming conventions](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/javascript/naming-convention-for-javascript), like CamelCase and snake_case.

#### History
Historically, the majuscule, upper case, letters came first. Alphabets were written entirely in upper case letters. Eventually, as writing speed by hand increased, the form of upper case letters would turn simpler and smaller forming the foundation of minuscule, lower case letters. Lower case letters also increased readability.
