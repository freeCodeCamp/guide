<p>
Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when there is a need for binary( in 0 or 1)  categorization of data.<br>
Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.

<H3>APPLICATION OF LOGISTIC REGRESSION</H3>
  <UL>
    <li> To categorize e-mails as Spam or Not Spam
    <li> To find whether a patient has a certain disease or not
    <li> To predict survival in case of disasters etc.
  </UL>

Now as we can clearly see in the graph that logistic regression curve passes through more data points and thus, has less noise(error scope) and is a better predictor.<br>
The graph has data points on x-axis and probability which is binary in this case on y-axis.<br>
Now if you watch closely linear regression line actually goes below 0 for some values which does not make any sense and thus for binary classifications we use logistic regression.
