## Mean
The most common measure of central tendency, or a value used to describe a set of numbers, is the arithmetic average, or mean. 
To find the mean (*A*) of a set of numbers , you add their values and divides by the number of values (*n*).

### Examples

*  **1, 4, 5, 2, 3**

    (1 + 4 + 5 + 2 +3) / 5 = 3
  
*  **20, 14, 23**

    (20 + 14 + 23) / 3 = 19
  
*  **-12, -20, -16, -21**

    (-12, -20, -16, -21) / 4 = -17.25\

The mean can be a great way to describe a set of numbers. However, it is important to realize that one value that is much higher or lower than the other values in the set can cause the mean to inaccurately represent a set of numbers.

### Examples

*  **2, 7, -3, 1, 0, 2, 857**

  (2 + 7 + (-3) + 1 + 0 + 2 + 857) / 7 = 123.71

*  **1276, 1141, 1271, 1053, 1**

  (1276 + 1141 + 1271 + 1053 + 1) / 5 = 948.4
