## Use the order Property to Rearrange Items

Before you make any changes, pay attention to the order of the colors. You get blue on the left and red ont eh right. After you set the `order` property you will be able to pick which one should be displayed first without having to change the html code.

```css
#box-1 {
    background-color: dodgerblue;
    order: 2;
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
  }
  ```
