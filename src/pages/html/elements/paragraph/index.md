## Paragraph

A paragraph is an essential part of any HTML website, and is arguably the most commonly used element there is. It is used as a shortened version of the word, using `<p>Paragraph text</p>`. The paragraph tag can be used for most common text that is going to be displayed on your site. 

The paragraph tag can have classes added to it, like most other elements. For example, `<p class="title">Title</p>`. This is a common practice in order to style or target certain paragraphs. For more information of paragraphs, check out the [MDN Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p).
