## Scrummasters

A scrum master is the sole lead of a scrum effort. Their role is specifically to remove obstacles ("blockers") that would otherwise prevent the team from producing deliverables and meeting goals. Importantly, a scrum master is not a team leader or a project manager, their primary responsibility is to free their team up from anything that would keep them from their objectives.
