A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network. When data is formatted into packets, and packet switching is employed, the bandwidth of the communication medium can be better shared among users than with circuit switching. Computer communications links that do not support packets, such as traditional point-to-point telecommunications links, simply transmit data as a bit stream.

A packet consists of control information and user data, which is also known as the payload. Control information provides data for delivering the payload, for example: source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in packet headers and trailers.
