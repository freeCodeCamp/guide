title: Fill In the Blank with Placeholder Text
---
Web developers traditionally use **lorem ipsum** text as placeholder text. It's called lorem ipsum text because those are the first two words of a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.

**lorem ipsum** text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.
