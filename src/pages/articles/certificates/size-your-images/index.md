title: Size Your Images
---
CSS has an attribute called `width` that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts, we'll use `px` (pixels) to specify the image's width.

For example, if we wanted to create a CSS class called larger-image that gave HTML elements a width of 500 pixels, we'd use: `<style> .larger-image { width: 500px; } </style>`.
