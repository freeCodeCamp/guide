title: How to Get Help When You Are Stuck
---
When you get stuck, remember: Read-Search-Ask.

1.  **Read** the documentation or error
2.  **Search** Google
3.  **Ask** your friends for help

This is the most time-efficient way to handle being stuck, and it's the most respectful of other people's time, too.

Most of the time, you'll solve your problem after just one or two steps of this algorithm.

We have a special chat room just for getting help: <a href='https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/help/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/help/</a>
