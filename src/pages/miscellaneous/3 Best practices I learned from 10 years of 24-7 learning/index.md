<h3>1.Always revise</h3> <p>Revision is a pillar of learning. It's not about remembering, or uploading info into your brain and stuff. 
True learning is about developing practical instincts about a skill, be it codeing or kung fu! my personal tricks to revise stuff is 
to try to replicate the results with or without minimum guidance, again and again over longer periods of time. for example:- once I
Learn how to make and app, I make it again the next day without any guidance; then 3 days later I do it again, then one week later 
I do it again; you the the point. Keep doing it until it is instinct.</p>

<h3>2.learning is a 24/7 job</h3> <p>To truly master a skill it takes time, a lot of time. Fortunately there are tricks to cut
the learning-curve short; the best trick of all is to completely immerse yourself in the skill. This means Read about it 24/7 (thousands
of free articles online and books), another great way is to practice and revise simple skills (like making lists or classes in HTML)
even after doing it is easy, the revision makes it more and more familiar and inturn more instinctive.</p>

<h3>3.Find Patterns in what you learn</h3> <p>Finding patterns is essential to learning. I can write a 1000 page article just on
the importance of finding patterns while learning. For example:- inside <style> </style> you can write (name of and element like "h2";
add a fullstop to make it a new class; or add a "#" to make it a new "id") and in that order the latter always overrides everything.
Except inline overrides everything. (there an hour of HTML compressed in a single line)(Patterns help memory). </p>

<h3>If you should take one thing away from this article make it "Don't forget what you learn, Don't quit halfway, and don't learn half-hearted" otherwise all that
time is wasted. Whatever you do, do it with all your heart.<h3>
