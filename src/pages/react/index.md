## React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

It's declarative: React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application. It's efficient: React computes the minimal set of changes necessary to keep your DOM up-to-date. And it's flexible: React works with the libraries and frameworks that you already know.

To describe component's DOM representations, React uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. A simple transform is included with React that allows converting JSX into native JavaScript for browsers to digest.
