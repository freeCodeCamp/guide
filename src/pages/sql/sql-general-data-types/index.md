## SQL General Data Types

SQL general data types consist of the following: 
1. A text- and/or numeric-based value, often referred to as a STRING
2. A numeric-only value, often referred to as an INTEGER
3. A calendar- and/or clock-based value, often reffered to as DATE or TIME
4. A database-specific value such as a boolean (two-option) flag, an array that stores multiple values within one data point

More information on the specific data types in SQL can be found in the [SQL Data Types] (https://guide.freecodecamp.org/sql/sql-data-types/) section of freeCodeCamp.
