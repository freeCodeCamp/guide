## Linux

Linux is an open source, unix based operating system created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.  Linux was first started as a clone of the MINIX operating system.  Open source contributors added onto the kernel and expanded its hardware compatability.  Linux's hardware supoort and free licensing made linux a popular choice for desktop and server computing in the mid 90s.  Today, linux is the most popular operating system in the world. It powers 90% of the world's servers, and is the basis of Google's popular Android operating system.


There are also many versions of Linux designed to be run on personal computers, such as Debian or Ubuntu. More importantly, these different versions of Linux (called distributions) allow the user varying degrees of personalization and control of the operating system. This means that users can choose their Linux distributions based on their wants and needs.
