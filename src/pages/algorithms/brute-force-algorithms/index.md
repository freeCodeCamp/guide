## Brute Force Algorithms

<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> Brute Force algorithms are algorithms which use trail and error method of all possible valid combinations of input until they arrive at the expected/successfull output. These algorithms work without any tact and rely on the brute processing power.</p>

<p> For E.g: A 5 digit password, in the worst case scenario would take 10<sup>5</sup> tries to crack.  </p>

<p> The time complexity of brute force is <b> O(n*m) </b>. So, if we were to search for a string of 'n' characters in a string of 'm' characters using brute force, it would take us n * m tries.</p>
