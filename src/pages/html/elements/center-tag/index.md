## Center Tag

The center tag is used to center align the text using <center> tag.It has an opening and closing tag.
  
Example:
<center> This gets displayed in the center of the page </center>
  
But <center> tag is no longer supported in HTML5.So use Center in CSS instead while styling.
  
Example:
<style>
h1 {text-align:center;}
p {text-align:center;}
</style>
