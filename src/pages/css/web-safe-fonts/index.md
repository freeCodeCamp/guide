## Web Safe Fonts

Web safe fonts are fonts that come pre-installed on most computer systems. You use web safe fonts when you want your content to look the same across a wide range of systems.

If a website uses a font you don't already have installed, the browser will choose the font. The content will then not look the way it is intended to look.

For a collection of web safe fonts, visit [CSS Font Stack](https://www.cssfontstack.com).
