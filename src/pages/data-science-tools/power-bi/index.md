Power BI is a commercially available product by Microsoft to provide data insights and visualizations for the data curious. 

## Core features:
Power BI has many features for data ingestion, analysis, and consumption:
 * Data content packs to bring in data from many sources, including GitHub, Facebook, AWS, Azure, and most SQL databases
 * Intuitive data modeling and transormation tools that can be automated for tables of similar structure or content
 * Stock charts and graphs (including force directed!) for drag-and-drop report and dashboard building
 * R console for advanced statistical analysis
 * Embedded capabilities for viewing of dashboards across different business groups or for public consumption
 
## How it is used for Data Science: 
While it is not as powerful for complex inference analysis or map reducing, it thrives in presenting data in interactive dashboards for typical business-type data consumers. PowerBI is the bridge between the data scientist and the rest of the business world who want to data for decision making in easy to understand visualizations. By leveraging the Office 365 environment that many consumers are familiar with, the Data Scientist can bring the most complex custom analysis or visualization through the R console for interaction by whomever is needed.
