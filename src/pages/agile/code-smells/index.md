Code smells are warning signs in the code that are typically indicative of a deeper underlying problem.

Code smells are typically not bugs, in that they do not stop the program from running. Rather, much like a bad smell indicates that there is something unpleasant nearby, code smells indicate that some sort of best practice has not been followed. They often result from hacked-together solutions put together quickly, and typically lead to difficult-to-maintain code and technical debt.

The solution to code smells is aggressive refactoring of code so that it follows consistent and well-understood design patterns. Turning longer methods into shorter methods and reducing logical complexity will reduce code smell. A program with less code smell will be easier to understand, and thus easier to troubleshoot and maintain.

Some of the more common types of code smells include:

* Long methods/classes
* Long lists of parameters
* Complex conditional statements
* Bad naming conventions
