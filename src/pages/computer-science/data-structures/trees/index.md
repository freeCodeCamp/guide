A tree is a data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges without having any cycle. A tree with no nodes is called a null or empty tree. A tree that is not empty usually consists of a root node and many levels of additional nodes that form a hierarchy.

# Terminology used in trees:

Root :
The top node in a tree.

Child:
A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.

Parent:
The converse notion of a child.

Siblings:
A group of nodes with the same parent.

Descendant:
A node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child.

Ancestor:
A node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.

Leaf(less commonly called External node):
A node with no children.

Degree:
The number of subtrees of a node.

Edge:
The connection between one node and another.

Path:
A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.

Level:
The level of a node is defined by 1 + (the number of connections between the node and the root). 

Height of tree:
The height of a tree is the height of its root node.

Depth:
The depth of a node is the number of edges from the tree's root node to the node.

Forest:
A forest is a set of n â‰¥ 0 disjoint trees. 


 An internal node (also known as an inner node, inode for short, or branch node) is any node of a tree that has child nodes. 
Similarly, an external node(also known as an outer node, leaf node, or terminal node) is any node that does not have child nodes.

# Some Popular Types of Trees:
Binary Tree,
 Binary Search Tree,
 AVL Tree,
 Red Black Tree,
 Splay Tree,
 Huffmann Tree

# Common uses
Representing hierarchical data, 
 Storing data in a way that makes it easily searchable,
 Representing sorted lists of data,
 Routing algorithms
