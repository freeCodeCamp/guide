## Required

The required attribute is a boolean attribute.

When present, it specifies that an input field must be filled out before submitting the form.

Note: The required attribute works with the following input types: text, search, url, tel, email, password, date pickers, number, checkbox, radio, and file.

Example:

``` html
<form action="/action_page.php">
  Username: <input type="text" name="username" required>
  <input type="submit">
</form>
```
The user will not be able to submit the form if username is not filled.
