## Law of Cosines

The Law of Cosines can be used to find the ramaining sides or angles of a non-right triangle when given either the length of two sides and its included angle (SAS) or the lengths of the three sides (SSS).
The Law of Cosines states:

This looks very similar to the Pythagorean Theorem, and if C was 90 degrees (a right triange), the expression acctually simplifies to the Pythagorean Thoerem.  So, the Pythagorean Theorem is a special case of the Law of Cosines.

You can also switch the angle C with either A or B, but make sure to change the respective side (c) to a or b.
