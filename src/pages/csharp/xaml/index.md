## XAML
	
XAML which stands for Extensible Application Markup Language is a declarative XML-based language that is used for initializing structured values and objects. XAML Developed by Microsoft and is used in .NET technologies, particularly Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Silverlight, Windows Workflow Foundation (WF). In WPF, XAML is used to define UI elements, data binding, events, and other features.
Anything that is implemented in XAML can be created using other .NET languages like C# or VB.NET. However, one of the key reasons of using the technology is the reduced complexity.


### Example
The following example shows a label with "Hello World!" as its content in a top level container called UserControl.
```XAML
<UserControl xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation">
    <Label Content="Hello World!" />
</UserControl>
```
