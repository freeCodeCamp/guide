## Divide and Conquer Algorithms

A divide and conquer algorithm is algorithm design paradigm that works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
Example of a Divide and Conquer Algorithm method to manage big data:
