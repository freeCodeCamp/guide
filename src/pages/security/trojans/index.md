## Trojans

Trojans are programs or software that actually appear to be legitimate but in reality are malicious or harmful.

An example is a program you download from the internet which claims to be an image editor but in reality, whenever you open it, malware is spread on your computer.

They can go unnoticed for a long time doing the following things meanwhile:
<ul>
 	<li>Spying on you by sending your information to another computer.</li>
 	<li>Using your computer for malicious purposes such as contributing to a Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS) attack.</li>
 	<li>Creating further loopholes in your security so other malware can also infect your computer.</li>
 	<li>Using up valuable disk space and making your computer slow.</li>
</ul>
In order to remain safe from Trojans, you should always download programs from reputable websites and also enable an anti-virus program like Avast or AVG on your computer.
