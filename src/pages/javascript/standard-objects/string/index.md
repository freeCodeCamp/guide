## String

In JavaScript the `String` global object is a constructor for strings, which store series of characters. Strings can be created in the form of literals, such as `var greeting = "Hi, campers!";` or using the `String` constructor: `var greeting = new String("Hi, campers!");`.

Unlike some other languages, JavaScript doesn't care if you use single `' '` or double `" "` quotes for strings. You can even use them *inside* the strings, they just have to be different from the quotes that embrace the string `"Isn't that awesome?"`.
