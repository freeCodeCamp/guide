Definition: Version	control	is	a	system	that	records	changes	to	a	file	or	set	of	files
over	time	so	that	you	can	recall	specific	versions	later.
If	you	are	a	graphic	or	web	designer	and	want	to	keep	every	version	of	an	image	or	layout	(which	you	certainly	would),	it	is very	wise	to	use	a	Version	Control	System	(VCS).

A	VCS	allows	you	to:
1) Revert	files	back	to	a	previous	state
2) Revert	the entire	project	back	to	a	previous	state
3) Review changes	made	over	time
4) See	who	last	modified	something	that	might	be causing	a	problem
5) Who	introduced	an	issue	and	when,and more.

Broadly, there are two types of VCS:
1) Centralized version control system
2) Distributed version control system
