## Area of a Parallelogram

A parallelogram is a four-sided flat shape with two pairs of parallel sides, where the opposite sides of a parallelogram are both equal to each other.

## Formula
To find the area of a parallelogram, we multiply the base by the height

**A = B * H**

*Where A is the area, B is the base and H is the height*

### Examples

Example 1: Find the area of a parallelogram with a base of 12 centimeters and a height of 5 centimeters.

Solution:

A = B * H

A = (12 cm) · (5 cm)

A = 60 cm2

Example 2: Find the area of a parallelogram with a base of 7 inches and a height of 10 inches.

Solution:

A = B * H

A = (7 in) · (10 in)

A = 70 in2
