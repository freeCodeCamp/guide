## Voice

### Alexa

The Alexa platform was created by Amazon, and formally released for development by external parties in 2015. It provides the ability for users to interact with Alexa enabled devices using just their voice, and no interaction with a touch screen. The platform contains both hardware and software components. Amazon manufactures and sells the hardware devices which come with a variety of features and price points.

The Amazon Echo Dot is a hockey puck sized device.

The Amazon Echo Tap is a battery powered device, and larger than the Dot.

The Amazon Echo is a full sized upright speaker that is roughly twice the size of the Tap.

The Amazon Echo Show is not only a voice activated speaker, but it also has a seven inch display, and shorter than the full sized unit.

Each of the devices have far field microphones, capable of hearing 25-30 feet away from the user.

The software components within the platform include both Natural Language Understanding (NLU) as well as Automated Speech Recognition (ASR).  These software components can be leveraged by custom written "skills" by independent software developers that are then certified to a set of standards by Amazon. There are already more than 20k of these custom skills available through their app store.
