## Behavior Driven Development

Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is an methodology used to answer two of the most difficult questions in software development: "What are we trying to accomplish?" and "How do we know when we are done?" BDD is not a specific tool or process, but can be thought of as a way of connecting  <a href='https://guide.freecodecamp.org/agile/user-stories' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>User Stories</a> to <a href='https://guide.freecodecamp.org/agile/test-driven-development' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Test Driven Development</a>. Teams that embrace BDD write user stories which clearly define all of the behavioral expectations of a feature in clear and consistent language. This allows a developer to build the feature with little or no additional information from the person who requested the feature. It also allows a developer and/or tester to write tests based on the requirements. BDD focuses on user experience, rather than on implementation. A recommended approach to BDD is to add details to User Stories which can correspond to tests.

__An example user story__
>#### As a user I want to request a password reset email
>* Should have an input box for an email address
>* Should validate input for a correctly formatted email address
>* Should show a message if the provided email address is not associated with an account
>* Should show a success message
>* Should have links to pages for logging in and for registering a new account

Successful BDD relies on clear and consistent language to describe behavior expectations. According to the principles of Agile, teams should be expected to refine the language and processes of BDD iteratively. Ideally BDD allows any member of a team to look at the requirements definition and have the same expectation of what a feature is and how a user would experience using it.
