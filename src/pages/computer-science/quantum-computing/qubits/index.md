## Qubits

The qubit, a portmanteau of *quantum* and *bit*, is the basic unit of quantum computing. 

A qubit is similar to a classical bit (also a portmanteau, of *binary* and *digit*), in that, like a classical bit, it can have one of two states, typically represented as with 0 and 1.

However, a qubit can also exist in a *superposition* of both states, which allows it to encode more information than a classical bit.
