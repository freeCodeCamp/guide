title: "Java Loops: continue Control Statement"

# Java continue Control Statement

The `continue` statement makes a loop skip all the following lines after the continue and jump ahead to the beginning of the next iteration. In a `for` loop, control jumps to the update statement, and in a `while` or `do while` loop, control jumps to the boolean expression/condition.

    for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
    {
        if (j == 5)
        {
            continue;
        }
        System.out.print (j + " ");
    }

The value of `j` will be printed for each iteration, except when it is equal to `5`. The print statement will get skipped because of the `continue` and the output will be:

    0 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9

Say you want to count the number of `i`s in a the word `mississippi`. Here you could use a loop with the `continue` statement, as follows:

    String searchWord = "mississippi";

    // max stores the length of the string
    int max = searchWord.length();
    int numPs = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < max; i++)
    {
        // We only want to count i's - skip other letters
        if (searchWord.charAt(i) != 'i')
            continue;

        // Increase count_i for each i encountered
        numPs++;
    }

    System.out.println("numPs = " + numPs);
