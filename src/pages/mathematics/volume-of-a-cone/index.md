Given the radius of the base of the cone, <span class="texhtml">r</span>, and the height of the cone, <span class="texhtml">h</span>, the volume of a cone is

<span class="texhtml">1/3 * π * r<sup>2</sup> * h</span>.

For example, the volume of a cone with radius of its base 8 units and height 18 units is <span class="texhtml">1/3 * π * 8 * 8 * 18 = 1206.37</span>.
