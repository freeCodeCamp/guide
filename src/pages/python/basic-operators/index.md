## Basic Operators

In Python, operators are the constructs, which can manipulate the value of operands. For example `2**3` will give result 8. Here 2 and 3 are operands and `**` is the operator.

### Types of Operator
Python supports the following types of operators

#####1. Arithmetic Operators
	
	Example Variables: a = 15 b = 30
	
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="font-weight:bold">Operator</td>
			<td></td>
			<td style="font-weight:bold">Explication</td>
			<td style="font-weight:bold">Code example</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Addition</td>
			<td>+</td>
			<td>Adds the values on both sides of the operator</td>
			<td>a + b = 45</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Subtraction</td>
			<td>-</td>
			<td>Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand</td>
			<td>b - a = 15</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Multiplication</td>
			<td>*</td>
			<td>Multiplies values on either side of the operator</td>
			<td>a * b = 450</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Division</td>
			<td>/</td>
			<td>Divides left hand operand by right hand operand</td>
			<td>b / a = 2</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Modulus</td>
			<td>%</td>
			<td>Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder</td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Exponent</td>
			<td>**</td>
			<td>Performs exponential calculation on operators</td>
			<td><p>2**3 = 8 <br>(2**3 &#8793 2^3)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Floor Division</td>
			<td>//</td>
			<td>The division of operands where the result will be rounded to the next lower integer</td>
			<td><p>10 // 3 = 3<br>-10 // 3 = -4</p></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
