# Java do..while Loop

The `do..while` loop is a special case of the `while` loop wherein the group of statements is guranteed to run atleast once before checking for a given condition. Confused? Ok, the follwing example should clear things up.

Can you guess the output of the following code snippet?

```java
int i = 10;
do{
    System.out.println("The value of i is " + i);
    i--;
} while(i >= 10);
```

`Remember` : The condition of a `do-while` loop is checked After the code body is executed once.

Now that you have some idea of basic syntax, let's delve into some of the most relevant and commonly used data types which will help you to develop programs in Java.Ja
