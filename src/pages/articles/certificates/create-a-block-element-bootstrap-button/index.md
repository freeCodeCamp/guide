title: Create A Block Element Bootstrap Button
---
Normally, your button elements are only as wide as the text that they contain. By making them block elements, your button will stretch to fill your page's entire horizontal space. Note that these buttons still need the `btn` class.

    <button class="btn btn-block">Like</button>
