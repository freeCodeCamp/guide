## Introduction

Vue.js is a progressive framework for building user interfaces.
It's core is focused on only the "view" layer and can be easily intergrated with existing libraries and projects.
But on the other hand, Vue.js can also be leveraged to create powerful single page applications by integrating with extensions
such as `vue-router` and `vuex`.

It's main attributes are the following:
* It's approchable: if you know basic HTML, CSS & JavaScript - then you'll be writing apps in Vue.js in no time!
* It's versatile: you can use it as a simple library or a fully featured framework
* It's performant: it's extremely performant out of the box with very little to almost no optimization required.
