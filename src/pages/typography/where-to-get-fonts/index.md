There are plenty of fonts out there one of the largest collections of free fonts is [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).


Follow these simple steps to embed google fonts in your site:

*go [here]( https://fonts.google.com/ ).

*Push the plus button next to the font you would like to embed.

*open the small tab that appears at the bottom of your screen.  There are two things you need to copy and paste from the screen that pops up.  

1) The link that should be pasted into the head.

2) the bit of CSS that you'll need to paste into your CSS file on the element or class you want to use with the font.
