## Code Reviews

Code reviews are common practice for many software development teams. Code reviews involve 
team members looking into each others' code submissions to check for bugs, incorrect logic or 
potential improvements. To those who have not experienced the code review process before, 
it can be intimidating, however, it is an invaluable process to help you 
grow as a developer.

Is is important to be humble throughout the code review process. Accept your mistakes, 
and be professional when pointing out improvements or errors in the code of your fellow
team members.
