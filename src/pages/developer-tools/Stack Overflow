## Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow(SO) is the largest and most trusted online developer community. This community is for developers to learn, share their knowledge. ( At the time of writing more than 55 million professional and student programmers visit SO each month.)

This aim of SO is a community approach to helping solve coding problems. SO is a question and answer site for programmers to share their knowledge and help one aonther.

Stack Overflow has two sides, people seeking help and people freely offering their time to help. There are rules to ensure that questions are well written. These rules are important but easy to follow. As you take part in using SO you get points and badges. These points unlock capabilities in the site. They  allow you to contribute as well as ask questions.

Throughout your career in development SO should be your first stop when you are stuck. But once you have grown in your skillset consider contributing to the answers. Contributing is rewarding and you will learn even more, than by only asking questions.
