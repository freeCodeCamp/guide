# What is Swift?

Swift is an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), general-purpose programming language developed by Apple Inc. They describe it as:

> Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design, yet also produces software that runs lightning-fast.<sup>1</sup>
