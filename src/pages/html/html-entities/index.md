## HTML Entities
HTML entities are special character in HTML that have a special meaning in a HTML document. When you want to use these entities such as greater than (>) or less than (<) in your text, you have to use character entities so that they will not be interpreted as tags.

## Character Entities
Programmers use character entities in order to diplay these reserved HTML entities properly in their text. Special characters that are not present on your keyboard can also be replaced by entities.
A character entity can be written like:
```
&entity_name;
OR
&#entity_number;
```
For example, to display the greater than sign (>) we can use the character entity: ```&gt;```	or ```&#62; ```

Advantage of using an entity name: An entity name is shorter and easier to remember.
Disadvantage of using an entity name: Some browsers may not support all entity names, so entity numbers have to be used.
