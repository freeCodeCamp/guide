## Sprint Planning Meetings

Sprint Planning Meetings should follow a specific agenda every time to allow all members of the development team equal say in what stories and tasks need to be taken on for that sprint. The Product Owner comes and provides the high-level features/tasks that need to be incorporated within the sprint. Then, it is up to the Scrum Master to facilitate the discussion amoungst the development team.

Out of a sprint planning meeting, the key artifacts that the team should produce are:

 *A Sprint Goal
 *A Sprint Backlog

With a sprint goal, the dev team determines exactly what is the "big picture" goal of the entire sprint; what is the ultimate goal of all the work being done? The sprint backlog is all the work, the "to-do" list of tasks that need to get done in order to achieve the sprint goal.
