## Kano Analysis

A Kano Analysis is a survey designed to determine which classification a need falls under to help prioritize the needs. 

### Steps:

1. Identify Customers
2. Determine the Customer Requirements
3. Develop a (functional and non-functional) Questionnaire for each of the needs/attributes
4. Test and Administer the Questionnaire
5. Tabulate and Analyze the Results
6. Decide how to Act on the Results


### Kano Model

The Kano Model is an insightful way of understanding and categorizing 5 types of Customer Requirements (or potential features) for new products and services.
It was created in the early 80’s by Japan’s professor Noriaki Kano, but continues today to be an essential tool for all organizations independent of industry or size. 

#### Purpose

- To communicate 5 universal categories of customer requirements that all product and service developers need to be aware of in order to remain competitive.
- To show how each of these 5 universal categories can influence satisfaction and dissatisfaction.
- To show how 2 of the categories add value and 2 of the categories detract from value, and 1 of the categories creates new value.
- To help organizations understand their customer needs better than their customers understand their own needs.
- To provide a mechanism to help organizations understand and classify all potential customer requirements or features into these 5 categories so they can prioritize development efforts on the things that most influence satisfaction and loyalty. This is done by the Kano Survey, or sometimes called a Kano Analysis.
