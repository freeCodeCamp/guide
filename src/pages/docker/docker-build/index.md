## Docker build

`docker build` created a docker image from a Dockerfile and a "context". A context can be a URL or a local PATH. You can name the image using the optional `-t` tag.

A Dockerfile will install dependencies during the build command, from a specified URL or local PATH. Any dependencies necessary in your containers must be specified in the Dockerfile.

Your image is now stored in your machineâ€™s local Docker image registry.

When you have Docker containers built, you can then run your app using the appropriate run commands.
