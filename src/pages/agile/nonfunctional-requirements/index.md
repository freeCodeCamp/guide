## Nonfunctional Requirements

A nonfunctional requirement is one of two types of requirements you will recieve from a product owner. A nonfunctional requirement specifies the criteria that judges the operation of the system, instead of what the system does. They are normally distinguished from functional requirements due to their use of adverbs or descriptors.

### Examples:

* The printer should print 5 seconds after the button is pressed
* The code should be written in Java
* The UI should be easily navigable
