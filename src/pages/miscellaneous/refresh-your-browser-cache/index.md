title: Refresh Your Browser Cache
---
You may have to do a "hard refresh" of a page in your browser if you have an out of date, cached version of that website.

While on the problematic site use the key combination below to trigger a hard refresh depending on your operating system:

*   Windows: `CTRL + F5`
*   Mac/Apple: `Apple + Shift + R or Command + Shift + R`
*   Linux: `F5`

If a hard refresh doesn't work, try opening the problematic page in your browser's private browsing mode.
