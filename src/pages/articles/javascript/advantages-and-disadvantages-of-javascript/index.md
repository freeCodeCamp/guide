title: Advantages and Disadvantages of javaScript

Like all computer languages, JavaScript has certain advantages and disadvantages. Many of the pros and cons are related to being a client-side language.

## Advantages of JavaScript

*   **Speed**. Being client-side, JavaScript is very fast because any code functions can be run immediately instead of having to contact the server and wait for an answer.
*   **Simplicity**. JavaScript is relatively simple to learn and implement.
*   **Versatility**. JavaScript plays nicely with other languages and can be used in a huge variety of applications. Unlike PHP or [SSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes) scripts, JavaScript can be inserted into any web page regardless of the file extension. JavaScript can also be used inside scripts written in other languages such as Perl and PHP.
*   **Server Load**. Being client-side reduces the demand on the website server.

## Disadvantages of JavaScript

*   **Security**. Because the code executes on the users' computer, in some cases it can be exploited for malicious purposes. This is one reason some people choose to disable JavaScript.
*   **Reliance on End User**. JavaScript is sometimes interpreted differently by different browsers. Whereas server-side scripts will always produce the same output, client-side scripts can be a little unpredictable. Don't be overly concerned by this though - as long as you test your script in all the major browsers you should be safe.
