### PHP- Vaiables Types

Varibles are the main way to store information in the middle way of a PHP program.
All variables in PHP are donated with a leading dollar sign like `$variable_name`.
Variables are assigned with the `= operator` , with the variable on the left-hand side and the expression to be evaluated on the right.

### Variable Naming

Rules for naming a variable is listed below:-
 1. Variables names must begin with a letter or underscores character.
 2.A variable name can consist of numbers, letters, underscores but you cannot use characters like `+ , - , % , ( , ) . &` in its name.
 3.Variable names are case-sensitive i.e. `($age and $AGE are two different variables)`.
