## Comments in HTML

The comment tag is an element used to leave notes within the code. The comment tag is frequently used to explain something in the code or leave some recommendations about the project. The comment tag makes it easier for a developer to understand the code, and/or code segment, at a later stage.

The comment tag is used as follows: <!-- [Your text here.] --> 

It is good practice to add comments to your code, especially when working with a team or in a company.  This helps future developers or fellow teammates know what your code is suppose to do and how to maintain it.

### Example
```html

<!-- You can comment out a large number of lines like this.
Author: xyz
Date: xx/xx/xxxx
Purpose: abc
-->
