## Area of a Parallelogram

The area of a parallelogram is the space enclosed by the perimeter of the parallelogram.

#### Terminology

Height (h) - The vertical length of the parallelogram from top to bottom. Measured at right angle with the base.

Base (b) - The horizontal width of the parallelogram from left to right.

#### Formula

Area of a parallelogram = b * h

#### Example

1. A parallelogram has a base of 6m and is 3m high, what is its area?

  Area of a parallelogram = b * h
    b = 6m
    h - 3m
    
  Area of a parallelogram = 6m * 3m
  Area of a parallelogram = 18m
