## RAM
In computer hardware, random-access-memory (RAM) plays the role of "active memory", acting as a working space where currently-running programs can manipulate data. Programs use RAM to store files that they have loaded, data that is currently being changed, and the computer's operating system. RAM is significantly faster than a disk drive, which is why it is used for data that is currently being worked on.

RAM plays an important role in computer performance. Computers with more RAM can generally run more programs at the same time without slowing down, which is useful when running a web browser, a development environment, and other programs simultaneously. Additionally, adding RAM is a relatively inexpensive way to increase the speed of most computers. When a computer has too little RAM, it must swap data between RAM and the disk drive, which results in slowdowns as the data is transferred between RAM and the disk drive.
