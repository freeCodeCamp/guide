# Personas

<p> A persona in is a fictional character created to represent a user type that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way. </p>

<p> A persona is depicted as a specific person but is not a real individual; rather, it is synthesized from observations of many people. </p>

<p> While a persona is usually presented as a one-page document, it is a way to communicate and summarize research trends and patterns to others. This fundamental understanding of users is whatâ€™s important, not the document itself. </p>
