title: Brute Force Algorithms
---

A brute force algorithm is a rather straightforward approach to solving a problem. It is based on trial and error where the programmer tries to merely utilize the computer’s fast processing power to solve a problem, rather than applying some advanced algorithms and techniques developed with human intelligence. It is a naive approach adopted by most beginner programmers in the initial stages of solving a problem, however it might not be the most optimal approach, as it might increase both space and time complexity.

A simple example of applying brute force would be linearly searching for an element in an array. When each and every element of an array is compared with the data to be searched, it might be termed as a brute force approach, as it is the most direct and simple way one could think of searching the given data in the array. However, there are better ways to search data which make use of more optimum algorithms like binary search, etc. which adopt a more innovative way to solve the same problem.

For example consider: 
Suppose you are asked to solve the following problem:
What are the two roots of the equation x2−6x+8=0 between 0 and 10?
Many of us, given a couple of years of algebra would use the formula for the roots of a quadratic equation to obtain these values. Others might factor the quadratic to obtain the same result. Some, especially those who are given to the use of computers for solving mathematics problems would use what we call 'brute force'. Having been told, in the problem, that the required values are between 0 and 10, we would simply calculate the values of the quadratic for each of these eleven possibilities and note which of them satisfied the equation.
