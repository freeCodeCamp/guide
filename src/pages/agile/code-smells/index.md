## Code Smells
Code smell (or bad smell) refers to structures in the code that:
* violate fundamental design principles
* negatively impact design quality

Code smells are usually not bugs. They are not technically incorrect and do not currently prevent the program from functioning. 

Instead, they indicate weaknesses in design that may slowly increase the risk of bugs or failures.

### Examples:
Comments

Dead Code

Duplicated code 

Long Method or Class

Long Parameter List

Uncommunicative or Inconsistent Name
