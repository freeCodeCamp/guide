## Problem 7: 10001st prime
### Method:
- A prime number is a number which is divided by 1 and itself.
- We can find a number is prime if it's not divisible by other prime numbers smaller than itself.

### Solution:
```js
function nthPrime(n) {

  //Primes array which will store all the prime numbers
  const primes = [2];
  
  //Num is the number we want to check
  let num = 3, isPrime = true;
  
  //Looping until primes array is equal to n
  while (primes.length < n){
  
    //All the primes numbers of a number is always <= it's square root
    let max = Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(num));
    
    for (let i = 0; primes[i] <= max; i++){
      if (num % primes[i] == 0) {
        
        //Looping till we find the prime
        isPrime = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    
    //if Prime found, push it to the array
    if (isPrime) primes.push(num);
    isPrime = true;
    
    //An optimization technique, since we know of all even numbers only 2 is a prime number, we can skip the rest
    num+=2;
  }
  
  //Returning the last number
  return primes[primes.length-1];

}
```
