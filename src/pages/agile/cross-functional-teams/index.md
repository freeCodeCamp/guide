## Cross Functional Teams

Cross-functional teams are teams that are made up of members who have the ability to implement a feature from the lowest relevant layer (e.g. the database) to the highest relevant layer (e.g. web page). These teams will not rely upon another team in order to complete their work, and thereby will not have any dependencies impeding their progress.

The idea behind a cross-functional team is that the team becomes intimately familiar with what it takes to make a particular piece of functionality work, and any hand-offs are either eliminated or minimized because any existing dependencies are between the members and not between teams.

The opposite of a cross-functional team is called a "component team"; a team who is only responsible for one level of the software stack.
