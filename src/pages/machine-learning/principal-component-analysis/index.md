title: Principal Component Analysis
---
**Principal component analysis** (PCA) allows us to summarize and to visualize the information in a data set containing individuals/observations described by multiple inter-correlated quantitative variables. Each variable could be considered as a different dimension. If you have more than 3 variables in your data sets, it could be very difficult to visualize a multi-dimensional hyperspace.

Principal component analysis is used to extract the important information from a multivariate data table and to express this information as a set of few new variables called **principal components**. These new variables correspond to a linear combination of the originals. The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of original variables.

The information in a given data set corresponds to the **total variation** it contains. The goal of PCA is to identify directions (or principal components) along which the variation in the data is maximal.

In other words, PCA reduces the dimensionality of a multivariate data to two or three principal components, that can be visualized graphically, with minimal loss of information.
