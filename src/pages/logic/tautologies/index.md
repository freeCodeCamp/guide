## Tautologies
### Definition
In logic, a tautology is a statement that is true in every possible case. The opposite of a tautology is a contradiction, a statement being false in every possible cases.
### Example
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>p</th>
    <th>q</th> 
    <th>p OR q</th>
    <th>p → p OR q</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</tq>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>

As we can see in the truth table, the statement "p → p OR q" is always true (see last column). 

#### Note
The arrow simply means "implies". p implies p OR q, it can also mean <i>if...then...</i>
