## What is If-Then-Else

Most programming langauges have an "If-then-else" function, where IF[condition]THEN[statement][ELSEstatments]. What this means is if you have a certain "condition" that could occur then the function would execute the "statment", but if the "condition" is not met, then the funciton would execute the other "statment."

    Dim y as integer
    
    x = 10
    y = 20 
    
    If x < y Then
      MsgBox(x & " is less then " & y)
    Else
      MsgBox(x & " is greater then " & y)
    End If 
    
    End Sub
