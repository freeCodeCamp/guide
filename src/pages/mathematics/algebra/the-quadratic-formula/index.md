## The Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula is a tool for solving quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree two.
A degree two polynomial is just a polynomial where the highest exponent of _x_ is 2. The following are examples of quadratic equations.

* ![x^2+x-1=0](https://github.com/jasonu/freecodecamp-images/blob/master/quadratic_irrational_roots.png "example quadratic equation")

The formula only applies to equations that have the form above where a polynomial equals zero.
In general, the formula applies to equations which have the form:

![ax^2+bx+c=0](https://github.com/jasonu/freecodecamp-images/blob/master/quadratic_equation.png "general quadratic equation")

Where _a_, _b_ and _c_ are coefficients of the polynomial. In this case the equation will have solution(s):

#### Example:
Suppose you wish to find the solutions to: ![x^2-5x+6=0](https://github.com/jasonu/freecodecamp-images/blob/master/quadratic_integer_roots.png "example quadratic equation"), then by plugging _a=1, b=-5, c=6_ into the quadratic formula we get:
* _x=2_,
* _x=3_.

#### Example:
The solution to: ![x^2+x-1=0](https://github.com/jasonu/freecodecamp-images/blob/master/quadratic_irrational_roots.png "example quadratic equation")
is obtained by setting _a=1, b=1, c=-1_ in the quadratic formula. This gives two irrational solutions or roots:
* _x=(-1+√5)/2_,
* _x=(-1-√5)/2_.
