## Contextual Inquiries

Contextual Inquiry is an immersive method to discover how a design performs in the context of its use. Designers can use contextual inquiry to discover aspects of a design that users may not consciously realize. Contextual inquiry involves both interviewing users and observing them in using the design in their own environment.

There are four things to keep in mind:

**Context** must be maintained – the designer should seek to understand the user's ongoing experience with the design, and for that, it is crucial to follow the user in their day-to-day life with the design.

**Partnership** – the designer should ask insightful questions to probe deeper into the user's understanding of the design. A user's answers will be more informative and more complete if they answer while they are using the design.

**Interpretation** – the designer should try to interpret the data collected from interviews and observations while they are still on-site with the user. It is critical to try to verify the accuracy of any hypotheses about the data with the user.

**Focus** – the designer should focus in on the user's mental model of how a design works. In situations where a designer may be confused or surprised as to a user's actions or answers to questions, the designer can take this opportunity to try to better understand the user's perspective, and incorporate that into furture iterations.
