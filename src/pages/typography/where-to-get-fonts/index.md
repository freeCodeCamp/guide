### Google Fonts
Online font services like Google Fonts provide an easy way to use different fonts on your site without needing to worry about whether or not the viewer has the font installed on their system. 

To use Google Fonts in your site, visit <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">fonts.google.com</a>. 
* Browse the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">site</a> to find the font that works best for your project.
* Once you've chosen, click the plus sign next to the font.
* A bar will appear at the bottom of the screen. Click on it.
* You will then be given several lines of code. Copy and paste the line of HTML into the head of your HTML file above the existing `<link>` element. Use the CSS code where necessary in your stylesheet. 

You're done! You successfully have new fonts for your site.
