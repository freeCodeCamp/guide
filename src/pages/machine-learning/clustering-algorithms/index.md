## Clustering Algorithms

Cluster analysis is performed to find structure within a collection of unlabelled data. Clustering algorithms partition a given data set  into homogeneous groups based on available  features, such that similar cases are  grouped together while dissimilar cases are in different groups. For example, cluster analysis can detect the presence of genres given a set of unlabelled movies.
