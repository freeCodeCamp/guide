## Doctype Declaration

A Doctype Declaration is a way to tell the browser how to render HTML page. Current HTML standard is HTML5 which should be declared at the top of your HTML document. 

**To indicate that your HTML document uses HTML5, use:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
### Compatibility

Some of the new HTML5 features are still unsuported, but doctype declaration will ensure that browsers ignore the features that are unsupported and interpret document in a HTML5 compliant way. Doctype declaration should always be used in HTML documents.
