<h1>Cryptography</h1>

The basic objective of cryptography is to enable two people to communicate through the unsecure channel in such a way that a third person cannot understand what is being said. This channel could be a telephone line or a computer network. 

<h3>Example</h3>
The information that Person1 wants to send to Person2, which we call "plaintext", can be text, numerical
data, or any type of data at all. Person1 encrypts the plaintext, using a predetermined key, and sends the resulting "ciphertext" over the channel. Person3, upon seeing the ciphertext in the channel, cannot determine what the plaintext was, but Person2, who
knows the encryption key, can decrypt the ciphertext and reconstruct the plaintext.
