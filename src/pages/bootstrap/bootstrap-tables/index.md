## Bootstrap Tables
A basic Bootstrap table has a light padding and only horizontal dividers.

    The ```.table class``` adds basic styling to a table:


Striped Rows
    The ```.table-striped``` class adds zebra-stripes to a table:


Bordered Table
    The ```.table-bordered``` class adds borders on all sides of the table and cells:


Hover Rows
    The .table-hover class adds a hover effect (grey background color) on table rows:


Condensed Table
The ```.table-condensed``` class makes a table more compact by cutting cell padding in half:


Contextual Classes
    Contextual classes can be used to color table rows (<tr>) or table cells (<td>):

The contextual classes that can be used are:

Class	Description
```.active```	Applies the hover color to the table row or table cell
```.success```	Indicates a successful or positive action
```.info```	Indicates a neutral informative change or action
```.warning```	Indicates a warning that might need attention
```.danger```	Indicates a dangerous or potentially negative action

Responsive Tables
The ```.table-responsive``` class creates a responsive table. The table will then scroll horizontally on small devices (under 768px). When viewing on anything larger than 768px wide, there is no difference.
