## Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook helps you create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations and rich text.   
 
You can use it for:
* data cleaning and transformation
* numerical simulation
* statistical modeling
* data visualization
* machine learning

The Jupyter notebook combines two components:

### A web application:  

The Jupyter Notebook App helps to edit and run notebook documents in a web browser,  combining explanatory text, mathematics, computations and rich media.

### Notebook document:

The Jupyter Notebook App can create a 'Notebook document' containing both code and rich text elements. A Notebook document can be both readable and executable.
