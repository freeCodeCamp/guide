## SQL Create Table Statement

A table is a group of data stored in a database.

To create a table in a database you use the `CREATE TABLE` statement. You give a name to the table and a list of columns with its datatypes.

Hereâ€™s an example creating a table named Person:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Person(
  Id int not null,
  Name varchar not null,
  DateOfBirth date not null,
  Gender bit not null,
  PRIMARY KEY( Id )
);
```

In the example above, each Person has a Name, a Date of Birth and a Gender. The Id column is the key that identifies one person in the table. You use the keyword `PRIMARY KEY` to configure one or more columns as a primary key.

A column can be `not null` or `null` indicating whether it is mandatory or not.
