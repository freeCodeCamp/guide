## Machine Learning

As a pioneer in artificial intelligence Arthur Samuel in 1959 defined Machine Learning as "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."

A more formal definition of Machine Learning is provided by Prof Tom Mitchell of CMU:

> "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Consider the example of a Machine Learning algorithm that plays chess. In this example, `E` refers to the experience of playing chess, `T` is the task of playing chess, and `P` denotes the probability that the program will win the next game of chess.

In general, machine learning problems can be classified into supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, you have the input and the labeled output, and you suspect that a relationship exists between the input and the labeled output. When you know neither what the labeled output is nor if a relationship exists, unsupervised learning will help you find structure in your data if there is one.

In sum, there are two broad categories of machine learning

1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning

There are however other subcategories of machine learning you may encounter such as Semi-supervised and reinforced learning.

  The first steps involved in any Machine Learning process is to categorize data points. This is called classification.
You need to select a key differentiator of the data. Say you are trying to identify if a certain image is of a male of female. you will need training data where you point to your code, specific nuances to look for which will help it identify if it is a female or a male.
  
  Say facial hair are a good method to differentiate a man. So you train your code to look for facial hair. This only increases the probability that the image it is looking it could be a male. Now based on how broad your training data is, your code may also find some female images which may have traces of facial hair. AFter going through multiple iterations of the smae data, your code would then need to learn more features such as shapes of chin, ears, cheekbones etc., All of these become decision trees, these are the features based on which your machine would could the probability of the image being of that of a male or a female.
  
  This is a very simple example of Supervised learning.
