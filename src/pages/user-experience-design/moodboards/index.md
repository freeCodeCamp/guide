UX Design: Moodboards

What is a moodboard you say?  A moodboard is a critical part of the design process for user experience designers.  The technical definition is:“A collection of assets and materials intended to communicate the style, voice, direction, and language of a particular design, brand, or project.”

A Moodboard is a visual display designed to cause an emotional response in the user.  They provide visual direction to potential users of an app or site as well as to members of the design team during the creation process.  The designer has a vision in mind, and is hoping to evoke a response or emotion when the moodboard is created. Moodboards used to be basic PDF’s.  Now many apps including those in the Adobe suite, as well as many 3rd party design apps make combining design, layout, media and assets intuitive and simple.   Creating a moodboard with one of these apps is a simple, creative, intuitive part of the design process. 
These boards are outstanding to share with clients during the design process as well to get input from members of a collaborative team during the creation process.
