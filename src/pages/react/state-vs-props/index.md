## State vs Props

When we start working with React components, we frequently hear two terms. They are `state` and `props`. So, in this article we will explore what are those and how they differ.

## State:

* State is something that a component owns. It belongs to that particular component where it is defined.
For example, A person's age is a state of that person.
* State is mutable. But it can be changed by only by that component that owns it. As I only can change my age, not anyone else.
* You can change a state by using `this.setState()`

See the below example to get an idea of state:

#### Person.js

```javascript
  import React from 'react';

  class Person extends React.Component{
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        age:0
      this.incrementAge = this.incrementAge.bind(this)
    }

    incrementAge(){
      this.setState({
        age:this.state.age + 1;
      });
    }

    render(){
      return(
        <div>
          <label>My age is: {this.state.age}</label>
          <button onClick={this.incrementAge}>Grow me older !!<button>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }

  export default Person;
```
In the above example,  `age` is the state of `Person` component. 

## Props:

* Props are similar to method arguments. They are passed to a component where that component is used.
* Props is immutable. They are read-only.

See the below example to get an idea of Props:

#### Person.js

```javascript
  import React from 'react';

  class Person extends React.Component{
    render(){
      return(
        <div>
          <label>I am a {this.props.character} person.</label>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }

  export default Person;

  const person = <Person character = "good"></Person>
```

In the above example, `const person = <Person character = "good"></Person>` we are passing `character = "good"` prop to `Person` component.

It gives output as "I am a good person", in fact I am.

There is lot more to learn on State and Props. Many things can be learnt by actually diving into coding. So get your hands dirty by coding.
