An AVL tree is balanched binary search tree. Named after their inventors, Adelson-Velskii and Landis, they were the first dynamically balanced trees to be proposed. They are not perfectly balanced, but pairs of sub-trees differ in height by at most 1, maintaining an O(logn) search time. Addition and deletion operations also take O(logn) time.

**Definition of an AVL tree**

An AVL tree is a binary search tree which has the following properties:
  * The sub-trees of every node differ in height by at most one.
  * Every sub-tree is an AVL tree.

AVL trees use rotation to keep the tree balanced. There are two types of rotation:
  * Left Rotation
  * Right Rotation

Often, there need to be a combination of rotation to achieve a balanced tree
