## Negative Exponents

A negative exponent is simply moving the exponent below the fraction bar. Lets take a power of 10. If we take _10³_ we get _10\*10\*10 = 1000_. If the exponent were negative, say _10⁻³_, it would equal _1/10³_, or _1/(10\*10\*10)_, or just _1/1000_.
This goes for any number, and any power. _2³ = 8_, wheras _2⁻³ = 1/2³ = 1/8_. The same goes for _5² = 25_ whereas 
_5⁻² = 1/5² = 1/25_
