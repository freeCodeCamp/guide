## Constants

A constant associates a name with a value of a particular type.

#### Example:
```swift
let name = "Chris Lattner"
```

You declare constants with the `let` keyword then give it a name `name` then you use an assignment operator `=` to assign the value `"Chris Lattner"` to the constant `name`.

Once you have declared a constant you don't need to use the `let` keyword anymore you just call it by its name.

The value of a constant can’t be changed once it’s set.
