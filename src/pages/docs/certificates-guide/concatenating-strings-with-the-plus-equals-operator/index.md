We can use the `+=` operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

## Note

Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

## Example

    var ourStr = "I come first. ";
    ourStr += "I come second.";
