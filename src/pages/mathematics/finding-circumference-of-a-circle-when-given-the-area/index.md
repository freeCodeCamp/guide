## Finding Circumference of a Circle When Given the Area

#### Terminology

Circumference (C) - The enclosing boundary of the circle is called circumference of the circle.

Radius (r) - The length of a line from any point on the boundary/cirumference of the circle to the centre of the circle is known as the radius of the circle.

Diameter (d) - The length of the line that passes across the circle through the centre of the circle, is called the diameter.

Pi (<span class="texhtml">π</span>) - A mathematical constant which is approximated as 3.14

#### Formula

###### Given radius of the circle

Circumference of circle =  <span class="texhtml"><i>2</i> * <span class="texhtml">π</span> * <i>radius</i></span>

###### Given diameter of the circle

We know that `diameter = 2 * radius`, so you can derive the area of the circle as below,

Circumference of circle =  <span class="texhtml"><span class="texhtml">π</span> * <i>diameter</i></span>

###### Given area of the circle

We know that the area of the circle (A), 
<br>A = π * (radius)<sup>2</sup>.
<br><br>From this,you can derive the area of the circle as below,

Circumference of circle =  <i>2</i> * &radic;<span style="text-decoration: overline"><span class="texhtml"><span class="texhtml">π</span></span> * &radic;<span style="text-decoration: overline">A</span>

#### Example
Given area of a circle = 100cm<sup>2</sup>, find the circumference of the circle

Circumference = 2 * &radic;<span style="text-decoration: overline"> (3.14)</span> * &radic;<span style="text-decoration: overline"> (100)</span>  = 35.44 <span>cm</span>
