#### What are progressive web apps?

PWAs appear to be more than just a fad, but a fundamentally different way of approaching what a website can and should be on whatever platform you are viewing it from. They can install portions of themselves onto devices for offline viewing, use service workers to deliver content as needed when a connection is available and best of all standardize certain functionality between mobile and larger devices. 


## Specifically Progressive web apps are:

* Responsive: to fit any form factor
* Connectivity independent: Progressively-enhanced with Service Workers to let them work offline
* App-like-interactions: Adopt a Shell + Content application model to create appy navigations & interactions
* Fresh: Transparently always up-to-date thanks to the Service Worker update process
* Safe: Served via TLS (a Service Worker requirement) to prevent snooping
* Discoverable: Are identifiable as “applications” thanks to W3C Manifests and Service Worker registration scope allowing search engines to find them
* Re-engageable: Can access the re-engagement UIs of the OS; e.g. Push Notifications
* Installable: to the home screen through browser-provided prompts, allowing users to “keep” apps they find most useful without the hassle of an app store
* Linkable: meaning they’re zero-friction, zero-install, and easy to share. The social power of URLs matters.

These apps aren’t packaged and deployed through stores, they’re just websites that took all the right vitamins.<sup>1</sup>
