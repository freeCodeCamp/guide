## Rust

Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency. Its design lets you create programs that have the performance and control of a low-level language, but with the powerful abstractions of a high-level language. These properties make Rust suitable for programmers who have experience in languages like C and are looking for a safer alternative, as well as those from languages like Python who are looking for ways to write code that performs better without sacrificing expressiveness. Rust runs the majority of its safety checks and memory management decisions at compile time, so that your program’s runtime performance isn’t impacted. This makes it useful in a number of use cases that other languages aren’t good at: programs with predictable space and time requirements, embedding in other languages, and writing low-level code, like device drivers and operating systems. Also used for web applications also powers the Rust package registry site, <a href='https://www.crates.io' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>crates.io</a>.
