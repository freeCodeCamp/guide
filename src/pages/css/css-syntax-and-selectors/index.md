## CSS Syntax and Selectors
<p>
A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block:
</p><p>
CSS selector
</p><p>
The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
</p><p>
The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
</p><p>
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
</p><p>
A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
</p><p>
In the following example all <p> elements will be center-aligned, with a red text color:</pre>
<pre>
p {
    color: red;
    text-align: center;
}
</pre>
