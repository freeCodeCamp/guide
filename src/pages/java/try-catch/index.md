# Try-Catch
The first step in constructing an exception handler is to enclose the code that might throw an exception within a try block. In general, a try block looks like the following:
```Java
function name(){
    try{
    //Code the attempt here    
    }catch(exception ex){
        //Catch ex exception
        }
}
```
