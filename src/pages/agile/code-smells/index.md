## Code Smells

A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system.<sup><a href='https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>1</a></sup>

There are two main points about code smells; They should be easy to identify (sniffable), and they do not necessarily mean the code is problematic, but a deeper investigation must be done to find out the true impact of that piece of code.

Code smells should be easily caught even by inexperienced programmers, even if they are not able to tell why that code is problematic. Getting a sense to what smells bad or not is part of a programmer's job and a code without bad smells will be a nice introduction to any project for newcomers.
