# What is an Accessibility Audit?

An accessibility audit is an evaluation of how well a product or service supports the needs of web users with disabilities and meets recommended or required guidelines. 
Compliance is determined by Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) which is developed through the W3C process in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world.

## What Can the Tools Do?

Tools can significantly decrease the amount of time used to determine accessibility issues. They are also helpful for people that are not well-versed in accessibility assessment.

## What Can't the Tools Do?

The automated tools only find a small number of compliance issues. Manual checks are still an absolute necessity to make sure a product is in compliance.
