The less than operator (`<`) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than the number to the right, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`. Like the equality operator, less than operator converts data types while comparing.

## Examples

      2 < 5  // true
    '3' < 7  // true
      5 < 5  // false
      3 < 2  // false
    '8' < 4  // false
