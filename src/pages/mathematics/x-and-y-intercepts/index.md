## X and Y Intercepts

The X intercept(s) are the point(s) on the X axis where the graph of the function crosses or touches the axis. They occur where ```y = 0```. 

The Y intercept is the point at which the graph of the function crosses the Y axis. It occurs where ```x = 0```. 

A function can have multiple X intercepts, but can only have a single Y intercept. 

To find the X intercept(s), set ```y = 0``` and solve the equation for x. 

To find the Y intercept, set ```x = 0``` and solve the equation for y. 

As an example, the X and Y intercepts have been solved for a typical line in the form ```y = mx + b```.
