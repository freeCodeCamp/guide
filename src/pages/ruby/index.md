## Ruby

Ruby is a programming language created to maximize developer happiness and readability. It is the high level scripting language that powers Ruby on Rails, which remains one of the more popular web development frameworks.

Ruby was created by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto with the goal of making Ruby "natural, not simple." Ruby is open source and free to use, copy, modify and distrubute. You can find the Ruby source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ruby/ruby).
