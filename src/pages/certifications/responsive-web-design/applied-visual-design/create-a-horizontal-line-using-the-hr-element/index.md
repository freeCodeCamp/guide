## Create a Horizontal Line Using the hr Element

The `hr` tag is one of the simplest HTML elements. It creates a thin horizontal line line across its parent element.

This lesson uses the `hr` tag to separate the title and content of a "card". So how do you create an `hr` element?

```html
<!-- It's this easy -->
<hr>
```

This element is self-closing, but to be friendly to parsers and style checkers you should add an explicit closing marker.
```html
<hr />
```

Whichever format you choose it will create a horizontal line as in [this lesson](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/create-a-horizontal-line-using-the-hr-element/) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Here is a screenshot from that lesson showing an `hr` element contained within a div.
