Docker is an open source project to automate the dployment of any software applications inside containers.  A container image is a lightwieght, stand-alone, execuateble package of a piece of software that includes everything need to run it.

Docker is available for both Windows and Linux environment. Docker container running on a single machine share that machine's oprating system kernel. Docker container isolates applications from one another. 


### Container Vs. Virtual Machines

* Container virtualises the Operating System and more portable, where as VMs virtualises the Hardware. 

* Container are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and dependencies togehter. VMs are an abstraction of physical hardware turning one server into many. Hypervisor helps VM to do so.
