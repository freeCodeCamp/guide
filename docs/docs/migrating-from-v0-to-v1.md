title: Migrating from v0 to v1
---

## Move source directories (pages, components, utils, etc.) under `src`

[We moved site source files under a "src"
directory](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/814) to cleanly separate
them from config/data/build folders so to make integration with various
JavaScript tooling (e.g. [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier))
simpler.

Everything related to webpack, loaders, Babel, React should work nearly
identically under v1 of Gatsby compared to v0 so this part of the migration is
super easy.

```bash
mkdir src
git mv pages src
git mv components src
git mv utils src
...
```

## `import { prefixLink } from 'gatsby-helpers'` is no more

Prefixing links is now handled automatically by the new `<Link>` component
provided by the `gatsby-link` package.

So just use `gatsby-link` everywhere and things will Just Work™.

## config.toml is now gatsby-config.js

If you previously added site metadata to `config.toml`, move that into
the new `gatsby-config.js`.

You need to remove all requires/imports of `config` in your code. Site-wide
metadata should now be "queried" using GraphQL.

A minimal config module would look like:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `My Sweet Gatsby Site!`,
  }
}
```

## Migrate wrapper components to template components

In v0, there was the concept of "wrapper" components that would render each
file of a given file type. E.g. markdown files would be rendered by a wrapper
component at `wrappers/md.js` and JSON files `wrappers/json.js`, etc. Data
would be parsed from the files and automatically injected into the wrapper
components as props.

**If you're *not* using wrappers in your site, feel free to skip this section.**

While this proved often intuitive and workable, it was overly prescriptive
and restricted the types of pages that could be created due to the required
1-to-1 relationship between files and pages.

So for v1, we're moving to a mode where sites must explicitly create pages
and create mappings between template components and data.

Gatsby's new data system turns your data into a queryable database. You can
query data in any way to create pages and to pull in data into these pages.

These mappings can range between straightforward and complex. E.g. a markdown blog
would want to create a post page for every markdown file. But it also might want to
create tag pages for each tag linking to the posts using that tag. See [this issue
on programmatic routes](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/421) and this
[blog post introducing work on v1](https://www.bricolage.io/gatsby-open-source-work/)
for more background on this change.

Here's an example of migrating a markdown wrapper to Gatsby v1.

### Add markdown plugins

Install Gatsby plugins for handling markdown files.

`npm install --save gatsby-source-filesystem@next gatsby-transformer-remark@next gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files@next gatsby-remark-prismjs@next gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe@next gatsby-remark-responsive-image@next gatsby-remark-smartypants@next gatsby-plugin-sharp@next`

Next add them to your `gatsby-config.js` file. Make your config file look something
like the following:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `My Sweet Gatsby Site!`,
  },
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `pages`,
        path: `${__dirname}/src/pages/`,
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
      options: {
        plugins: [
          {
            resolve: `gatsby-remark-responsive-image`,
            options: {
              maxWidth: 690,
            },
          },
          {
            resolve: `gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe`,
          },
          `gatsby-remark-prismjs`,
          `gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files`,
          `gatsby-remark-smartypants`,
        ],
      },
    },
    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
  ],
}
```

### Create slugs for markdown files

It's handy to store the pathname of "slug" for each markdown page with the
markdown data. This let's you easily query the slug from multiple places.

Here's how you do that.

```javascript
// In your gatsby-node.js
const path = require('path')

exports.onCreateNode = ({ node, boundActionCreators, getNode }) => {
  const { createNodeField } = boundActionCreators
  let slug
  if (node.internal.type === `MarkdownRemark`) {
    const fileNode = getNode(node.parent)
    const parsedFilePath = path.parse(fileNode.relativePath)
    if (parsedFilePath.name !== `index` && parsedFilePath.dir !== ``) {
      slug = `/${parsedFilePath.dir}/${parsedFilePath.name}/`
    } else if (parsedFilePath.dir === ``) {
      slug = `/${parsedFilePath.name}/`
    } else {
      slug = `/${parsedFilePath.dir}/`
    }

    // Add slug as a field on the node.
    createNodeField({ node, fieldName: `slug`, fieldValue: slug })
  }
}
```

Now we can create pages for each markdown file using our slug. In the same
`gatsby-node.js` file add:

```javascript
exports.createPages = ({ graphql, boundActionCreators }) => {
  const { createPage } = boundActionCreators

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const pages = []
    const blogPost = path.resolve("src/templates/blog-post.js")
    // Query for all markdown "nodes" and for the slug we previously created.
    resolve(
      graphql(
        `
        {
          allMarkdownRemark {
            edges {
              node {
                fields {
                  slug
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      `
      ).then(result => {
        if (result.errors) {
          console.log(result.errors)
          reject(result.errors)
        }

        // Create blog posts pages.
        result.data.allMarkdownRemark.edges.forEach(edge => {
          createPage({
            path: edge.node.fields.slug, // required
            component: blogPost,
            context: {
              slug: edge.node.fields.slug,
            },
          })
        })

        return
      })
    )
  })
}
```

So we've now generated the pathname or slug for each markdown page as well as
told Gatsby about these pages. You'll notice above that we reference a blog
post template file when creating the pages. We haven't created that yet so
let's do it.

In your `src` directory, create a templates directory and add `blog-post.js`.

This is a normal React.js component with a special Gatsby twist—a GraphQL query
specifying the data needs of the component. As a start, make the component look
like the following. You can make it more complex once the basics are working.

```javascript
import React from "react"

class BlogPostTemplate extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const post = this.props.data.markdownRemark

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{post.frontmatter.title}</h1>
        <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.html }} />
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default BlogPostTemplate

export const pageQuery = graphql`
query BlogPostBySlug($slug: String!) {
  markdownRemark(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug }}) {
    html
    frontmatter {
      title
    }
  }
}
`
```

At the bottom of the file you'll notice the graphql query. This is how pages
and templates in Gatsby v1 get their data. In v0, wrapper components had little
control over what data they got. In v1, templates and pages can query for
exactly the data they need.

There will be a more in-depth tutorial and GraphQL-specific documentation soon
but in the meantime, check out http://graphql.org/ and play around on Gatsby's
built-in GraphQL IDE (Graph*i*QL) which can be reached when you start the
development server.

At this point you should have working markdown pages when you run `gatsby
develop`! Now start gradually adding back what you had in your wrapper
component adding HTML elements, styles, and extending the GraphQL query as
needed.

Repeat this process for other wrapper components you were using.

## html.js

This should generally work the same as in v0 except there are two additional
props that must be added to your HTML component. Somewhere in your `<head>` add
`{this.props.headComponents}` and somewhere at the end of your body, remove
loading `bundle.js` and add `{this.props.postBodyComponents}`.

## _template.js is now src/layouts/index.js

You should be able to copy your `_template.js` file directly making only one
change making `this.props.children` a function call so `this.props.children()`.
The rational for this change is described [in this PR
comment](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/940#issuecomment-300878300).

Nested layouts are *not* supported yet but are on the roadmap for v1.
