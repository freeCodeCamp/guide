## Divide and Conquer Algorithms

Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic paradigm. A typical Divide and Conquer algorithm solves a problem using following three steps:

1. Divide: Break the given problem into subproblems of same type.
2. Conquer: Recursively solve these subproblems
3. Combine: Appropriately combine the answers

Examples of Divide and Conquer Algorithms:

* Binary Search
* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Strassen Algorithm

and many more.
