# Clustering Algorithms
Clustering is the process of dividing data into separated groups (clusters), while ensuring that:
- Each cluster contains similar objects
- Objects which do not belong to the same clusters are not similar

Clustering algorithms help find structure in a collection of unlabelled data and fall in the category of unsupervised learning. 

The difficulty lies in the definition of a similarity measure that can separate the data in the way you want. For instance, a group of persons can be separated by gender, hair color, weight, race, etc.

Clustering algorithms have the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory data mining, and a common technique for statistical data analysis. It's used in many fields, including machine learning, pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, and computer graphics.

Some applications of clustering algorithms include:
* Grouping consumers according to their purchase patterns
* Grouping photos of animals of the same kind together
* Classification of different types of documents 

## Types of Clustering Algorithms:
1. Connectivity-based clustering (hierarchical clustering)
2. Centroid-based clustering (k-means clustering)
3. Distribution-based clustering 
4. Density-based clustering 

## Examples 
1. Alogmerative clustering
2. K-means clustering
3. K-mediods clustering
4. Partition Clustering

### K-Means Clustering

K-means algorithm is a popular clustering algorithm since it is relatively simple and fast, as opposed to other clustering algorithms. The algorithm is defined as the following:

1. Decide input parameter k (number of clusters)
2. Pick k random data points to use as centroids
3. Compute distances for all data points to each k centroids, and assign each data point to a cluster containing the closest centroid
4. Once all data points have been classified, compute the midpoint of all points for each cluster and assign as new centroid
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the centroids converge upon certain k points.


Since we only need to calculate k x n distances (rather than n(n-1) distances for knn algorithm), this algorithm is quite scalable.

Here's a clustering example in Python that uses the [Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris)

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
iris = pd.read_csv('Iris.csv')
del iris['Id']
del iris['SepalLengthCm']
del iris['SepalWidthCm']

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
# k is the input parameter set to the number of species
k = len(iris['Species'].unique())
for i in iris['Species'].unique():
    # select only the applicable rows
    ds = iris[iris['Species'] == i]
    # plot the points
    plt.plot(ds[['PetalLengthCm']],ds[['PetalWidthCm']],'o')
plt.title("Original Iris by Species")
plt.show()

from sklearn import cluster
del iris['Species']
kmeans = cluster.KMeans(n_clusters=k, n_init=10, max_iter=300, algorithm='auto')
kmeans.fit(iris)
labels = kmeans.labels_
centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_

for i in range(k):
    # select only data observations from the applicable cluster
    ds = iris.iloc[np.where(labels==i)]
    # plot the data observations
    plt.plot(ds['PetalLengthCm'],ds['PetalWidthCm'],'o')
    # plot the centroids
    lines = plt.plot(centroids[i,0],centroids[i,1],'kx')
    # make the centroid x's bigger
    plt.setp(lines,ms=15.0)
    plt.setp(lines,mew=2.0)
plt.title("Iris by K-Means Clustering")
plt.show()
```

Since the data points belong usually to a high-dimensional space, the similarity measure is often defined as a distance between two vectors (Euclidean, Manhathan, Cosine, Mahalanobis...)
