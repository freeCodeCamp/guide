## CSS-Preprocessors
<p>
A CSS preprocessor is a CSS add-in that adds previously unavailable features to CSS, using new syntax.
  </p><p>
The main task of the preprocessor is to provide convenient syntactic constructions for the developer to simplify, and thereby speed up the development and support of styles in projects.
  </p>
<p>CSS preprocessors convert code written using a preprocessor language into pure and valid CSS code.</p>
<p>With preprocessors, you can write code that targets:</p>
<ul><li>
Readability for humans
  </li><li>
Structured and logical
  </li><li>
Performance
  </li></ul>
<p>And this is only a small part of what the preprocessor can give you. But do not run ahead.<p>
