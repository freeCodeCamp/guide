### Bayes Classifier

It is a classification technique based on Bayes’ Theorem. It assumes  independence among predictors.  Naive Bayes works as if  presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. In other words,  all  these properties independently contribute to the probability. Even if these features depend on each other or upon the existence of the other features. That is why it is known as ‘Naive’.
