Naive Bayes is a machine learning algorithm for classification problems. It is based on Bayesâ€™ probability theorem. It is primarily used for text classification which involves high dimensional training data sets. A few examples are spam filtration, sentimental analysis, and classifying news articles.

It is not only known for its simplicity, but also for its effectiveness. It is fast to build models and make predictions with Naive Bayes algorithm. Naive Bayes is the first algorithm that should be considered for solving text classification problem. Hence, you should learn this algorithm thoroughly.


Naive Bayes algorithm is the algorithm that learns the probability of an object with certain features belonging to a particular group/class. The Naive Bayes algorithm is called "naive" because it makes the assumption that the occurrence of a certain feature is independent of the occurrence of other features.


Mathematics :

P(A/B)  = (P(B/A)* P(A))/P(B)


P(A|B): Probability (conditional probability) of occurrence of event A  given the event B is true
P(A) and P(B): Probabilities of the occurrence of event A and B respectively
P(B|A): Probability of the occurrence of event B  given the event A is true
