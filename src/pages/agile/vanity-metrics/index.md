## Vanity Metrics

Where Vanity is the value of appearance over quality, Vanity Metrics are measurements that, without context or explanation, are used to make someone or something look good. Eric Ries, posting at [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2010/02/entrepreneurs-beware-of-vanity-metrics), suggests metrics should be **actionable**, **accessible**, and **auditable** to have meaning.
