Use it to locate files by path, size, date, owner and a bunch of other useful filters.

Example: <code>date \\\"+It's %l:%m%p on %A\\\"</code>. Use it in a script to name files according to the current date.</li>\\n<li><code>ls</code> What’s in this directory? Combine <code>ls</code> with some useful flags to display and sort directory contents by date and size. It also gives you lots of options for formatting the output.</li>\\n<li><code>pwd</code> Where am I? Linux can be unforgiving, particularly when you delete something.

Example: <code>grep 'root' /etc/passwd # root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash</code></li>\\n<li><code>sed</code> Use sed to find and change a substring in a piece of text.
