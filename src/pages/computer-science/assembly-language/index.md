Assembly Language is the interface between higher level languages (c++, Java, ect) and machine code (binary). Upper level code is compiled into assembly code.

Assembly languages are devided into different Instruction Set Architectures (ISA) which are the basic instructions that the CPU can understand. More complex instuctions from the upper level language are decomposed by the compiler into the simpler operations in the instruction set. Different computer architectures have Different ISAs. A few common ISAs are MIPS, ARM, Intel x86, RISC-V.

Assemblers decompose Assembly instructions into their respective binary representations. Assemblers replace the generic addresses of assembly code with explicit register and memory addresses of your computer.

Programmers will write code in Assembly if execution speed and control is absolutely paramount. Otherwise upperlevel languages are used for easier development
