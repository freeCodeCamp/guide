Length values are used by many CSS properties. For example margin, font-size, border-width, and so on. 

Length units can be either relative or absolute. Generally, relative units are better for scaling. 

#### Relative Length Units
Unit |Relative to
-----|-----------
em |Font size of the element (3em = 3 times the size of the current font)
ex |Height of the x-charachter
ch |With of the 0-charachter (zero)
rem |Font size of the root element
vm |Percentage of the viewport width (1vm = 1% of the viewport). Especially useful for scaling.
vh |Percentage of the viewport height
vmin |Percentage of the smaller dimension of the viewport
vmax |Percentage of larger dimension of the viewport

#### Absolute Length Units
Unit |Relative to
-----|-----------
cm |centimeters
mm |millimeters
in |inches (1in = 96px)
px |pixels (1px = 1/96 in)
pt |points (1pt = 1/72 in)
pc |picas (1pc = 12pt)
