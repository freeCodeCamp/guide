## Visual Hierarchy

Visual hierarchy is the organization and presentation of content. You can use visual hierarchy to focus users' attention and show where the most important information is.

You can achieve visual hierarchy in many ways, including (but not limited to):

* Size
* Color and contrast
* Headings and subheadings
* Fonts
* White or blank space
* Texture
* Position
* Orientation
* Overall layout
