### Definition 
   A sequence of program instructions given to the operating system to execute. It is the smallest synchronous sequence that can be executed. Being synchronous, instructions in a thread are linear and execute one after another. If a program has multiple threads, the program as a whole can be asynchronous in that these threads are executing their own instructions independently of each other (simultaneously).

   A common distinction one should make is the difference between threads and processes. A thread is a child of a process so to speak. A process may contain many threads.
