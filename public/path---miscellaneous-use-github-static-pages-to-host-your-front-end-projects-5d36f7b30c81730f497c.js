But as the fcc projects got more complex, I realized coding locally was going to save me a bunch of headaches. My text-editor and <a href='https://incident57.com/codekit/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>codekit</a> combo are just waaay faster.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Autocomplete</li>\n<li>Compile everything (codepen was really dragging trying to compile Jade)</li>\n<li>Better auto-refresh</li>\n<li>Built in bower</li>\n<li>Git versioning</li>\n<li>Improved screen real-estate experience</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Git to Github</h2>\n<p>Since I’m already saving locally, and using git for version control, I figured might as well upload to Github. Plus, Github has a fantastic, free service for front-end projects called <a href='https://pages.github.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Github Pages</a>. Just update your repo and your changes are live.</p>\n<p>How it works is simple. Github checks if your repository has a branch called <code>gh-pages</code> and serves any code that’s sitting in that branch. No back-end stuff here, but HTML, CSS and JS work like a charm.</p>\n<h2>First things first</h2>\n<p>Let’s make a new folder for your project. I’ll use the <a href='http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/stylize-stories-on-camper-news' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Camper News</a> project as my example.</p>\n<p>Got to your work directory and make a new one. You can do this in the terminal (or not).</p>\n<p><img src=\"//discourse-user-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/2/2e3faaa2752657c592a9991ceed29a0200f332e6.png\" alt=\"Project Directory\"></p>\n<p>Now, go into the project directory, and (for sure in the terminal this time) use the command <code>git init</code>. Note, this tutorial assumes <a href='https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>you have git installed</a>.</p>\n<p>Alright, awesome. Now we’re ready to work.</p>\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n<p>Create some files in your campNews directory. I don’t know, maybe an index.html and probably app.css and app.js, or whatever naming convention you prefer. Put your code in these files. Alright, now we’re ready for our first commit. It takes <strong>two steps</strong>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>git add -A</code> will prep all these new files and the new code inside them</li>\n<li><code>git commit -m 'relevant message'</code> will commit all the work you’ve done to the branch you’re currently on (‘master’ by default)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The key to this whole thing</h2>\n<p>OK, so far we’re still local. There’s some stuff we gotta do to take our work and move it to github. It’s at this point I like to switch branches. Remember - github only serves from gh-pages, and if you’ve followed along so far, your branch is called ‘master’. Let’s make a new (local) gh-pages branch.</p>\n<p><code>git checkout -b gh-pages</code> will create it, copy all the work from master into gh-pages and switch me over to the branch. Phew.</p>\n<p><code>git branch -d master</code> will get rid of the master branch. Sounds crazy I know, but what do we need it for? Just think of gh-pages as your NEW master branch.</p>\n<p>Now, <code>git add -A</code> and <code>git commit -m 'relevant message'</code> again, just in case. And be prepared to leave your editor and terminal and go online for the first time.</p>\n<p>Go to your github profile and create a new repo. Name it something relevant, like campNews.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//discourse-user-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/3/3f113af87b94fcd649c78d5f6d36463795671e7b.png\" alt=\"New Repo\"></p>\n<p>Once it’s created, go in and grab the HTTPS clone URL. (Ignore the files in my screenshot, your repo will be empty at this point).</p>\n<p><img src=\"//discourse-user-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/a/a0f3da26ba0802342d7d6f7890763a2bca32b62a.png\" alt=\"clone url\"></p>\n<h2>Putting it all together</h2>\n<p>And you can leave the online world. Back to the terminal! Let’s connect our local project to this github repo. All it takes is one command.</p>\n<p><code>git remote add origin &#x3C;server></code> Just replace server with the HTTPS url you just copied. So my command looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/gkobilansky/campNews.git</code>.</p>\n<p>OK, so far we’ve:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Created our project</li>\n<li>Versioned it in git</li>\n<li>Commited some changes</li>\n<li>Switched it to the ‘gh-pages’ branch</li>\n<li>Connected it to github</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Last step!</h2>\n<p>Push you project to github. Again, simple:</p>\n<p><code>git push origin gh-pages</code></p>\n<p>That command will make sure your latest commits get uploaded to github. Once you’ve done this at least once, your project should be available <a><a href=\"http://_username_.github.io/_repository_\">http://<em>username</em>.github.io/<em>repository</em></a></a>, so for me it’s <a href='http://gkobilansky.github.io/campNews' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>http://gkobilansky.github.io/campNews</a>.</p>\n<p>Once this is all done, the process just repeats itself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>git add -A</code></li>\n<li><code>git commit -m 'relevant message'</code></li>\n<li><code>git push origin gh-pages</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Granted, steeper learning curve than codepen.io, but faster and more flexible once you get the hang of it.</p>\n<p>Happy coding!</p>\n<p>PS.
