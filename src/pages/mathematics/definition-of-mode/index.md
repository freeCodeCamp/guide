## Definition of Mode
In statistics, the term _mode_ refers to the value or values in a set of data that appears the most frequently. Because it occurs most often in the data set, the _mode_ is the most likely value to be randomly sampled.

#### Example

The mode of ( 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5 ) is **2**:

_To find the mode you must count the number of occurrences of each value in the data set. The value 2 appears twice in the data set, and the rest of the values occur only once, which makes 2 th mode._

The mode of ( 7, 7, 8, 8, 9 ) is 7 **and** 8:

_If there is a tie for the values that occur most frequently in the data set, the mode is each of the values with this frequency._


#### Mean and Median
Mode is often confused with [mean](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/mathematics/definition-of-mean), the average value in the data set
[median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median), the value in the middle of the data set.
