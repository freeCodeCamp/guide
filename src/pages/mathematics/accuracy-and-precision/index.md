## Accuracy and Precision

![alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Accuracy_and_precision.svg/300px-Accuracy_and_precision.svg.png)

Precision is a description of random errors, a measure of statistical variability.

Accuracy has two definitions:
- It is a description of systematic errors, a measure of statistical bias; this is the cause of the difference between a result and a "true" value.
- Alternatively, ISO defines accuracy as describing a combination of both types of observational error above (random and systematic), so high accuracy requires both high precision and high trueness.
