## Hr Tag

The horizontal rule or `<hr>` is a tag that allows to insert a divisory line, defining the content of your document.
It's very important to clarify that this tag is a thematic break; in previous versions of .html is a horizontal rule.

### Example
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>FreeCodeCamp</h2>
    <p>FreeCodeCamp is a place where you can learn to code from scratch to professional</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>How to start</h3>
    <p>Just go to <a href="www.freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp website and start learning!</a></p>

    <hr>
  </body
</html>
```
