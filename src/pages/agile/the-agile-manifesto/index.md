## The Agile Manifesto

Manifesto for agile software development: 
  - Individuals and interactions over process and tools.
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation.
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
  - Responding change over following a plan.

"We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work, we have come to value."
