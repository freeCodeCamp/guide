XAML, an abbreviation for eXtensible Application Markup Language, is a declarative markup language used to define user interfaces in certain platforms. XAML is used primarily by Microsoft for different development platforms like WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), Silverlight, Windows Phone, UWP (Universal Windows Platform) applications, and Xamarin. It provides an alternative approach to creating user interfaces using XML-style tags, instead of creating in code.

### Example:

XAML declaration of a button in WPF:
```
<StackPanel Name="sPanel" Height="200" Width="200">
  <Button Name="btnSubmit" Height="23" Width="75" Content="Click" />
</StackPanel>
```
The button when created in C#:
```
Button btnSubmit = new Button();
btnSubmit.Height = 23.0;
btnSubmit.Width = 75.0;
btnSubmit.Content = "Click";

StackPanel sPanel = new StackPanel();
sPanel.Height = 200.0;
sPanel.Width = 200.0;

sPanel.Children.Add(btnSubmit);
```

### Advantages of XAML:
1. XAML markup is much more succinct and readable than equivalent code
2. Parent-child hierarchy in XAML mimics the parent-child hierarchy of the user interface objects with greater visual clarity
3. XAML may be hand-written and is also easily generated by visual design tools

### Editors for XAML:
1. Visual Studio
2. XAMLPad
3. Kaxaml
