In Ruby you can perform all standard math operations on numbers, including: addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, division `/`, find remainders `%`, and work with exponents `**`.

## Addition:

*   Numbers can be added together using the `+` operator.

    15 + 25
    # returns:
    40

## Subtraction:

*   Numbers can be subtracted from one another using the `-` operator.

    25 - 15
    # returns:
    10

## Multiplication:

*   Numbers can be multiplied together using the `*` operator.

    10 * 5
    # returns:
    50

## Division:

*   Numbers can be divided by one another using the `/` operator.

    10 / 5
    # returns:
    2

## Remainders:

*   Remainders can be found using the modulus `%` operator.

    10 % 3
    # returns:
    1 # because the remainder of 10/3 is 1

## Exponents:

*   Exponents can be calculated using the `**` operator.

    2 ** 3
    # returns:
    8 # because 2 to the third power, or 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
