## A Tag

A tag, or sometimes known as an anchor tag, creates a hyperlink to other website or to different locations within your own application. 
Use of the anchor tag ranges from hyperlinking to your social media with the use of icons that have associated anchor tags, to directing where a button will lead your user to within a static website. 

```html
<a href="#home">Home</a>
```
This anchor tag, will send you back 'Home' within the website. The '#' before 'home' indicates that the location is local as the symbol denotes the name of a local id. 

```html
<a href="http://www.google.com">Home</a>
```
Since in the above example, the location is no longer local, it needs to be accompanied by 'http://' before you enter the web address. This indicates to the anchor tag, to look up a link on your browser instead of locally.

```html
<a href="mailto:noone@nowhere.none">Hit me up with an email!</a>
```
The above example includes an anchor tag attribute of 'mailto'. This enables the user to click on the link and be direct to send an email to the outlines 'mailto' address. This will prompt your local email application to open with the preloaded email ready to go.

Anchor tags can be used to make clickable images and icons and can be found on every single website.
