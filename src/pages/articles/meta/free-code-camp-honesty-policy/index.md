title: Free Code Camp Honesty Policy
---
Before we issue our verified certificate to a camper, he or she must accept our Academic Honesty Pledge, which reads:

1.  I understand that plagiarism means copying someone else's work and presenting the work as if it were my own, without clearly attributing the original author.

2.  I understand that plagiarism is an act of intellectual dishonesty, and that people usually get kicked out of university or fired from their jobs if they get caught plagiarizing.

3.  Aside from using open source libraries such as jQuery and Bootstrap, and short snippets of code which are clearly attributed to their original author, 100% of the code in my Algorithms, Back End Projects and Front End Projects was written by me or along with another camper with whom I was pair programming in real time.

4.  I pledge that I did not plagiarize any of my Free Code Camp work, and that I am OK with any random auditing Free Code Camp may do to confirm this.
