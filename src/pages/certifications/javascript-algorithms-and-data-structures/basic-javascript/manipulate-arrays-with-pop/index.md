## Manipulate Arrays With pop()

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
Remove the last element of an array with the pop() method, like so:

```javascript
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr.pop(); // This got rid of 5
```
