## Use export to Reuse a Code Block

We learned how to import stuff from another file. But there's a catch. You can only import files that are **exported** from that other file. 

Your task here is to export `foo` and `bar`.

## Hint 1:

Just add export in front of them!

## Spoiler Alert - Solution Ahead!

## Solution

```javascript
"use strict";
export const foo = "bar";
export const bar = "foo";
```
