title: Create A Set of Radio Buttons
---
You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer.

Radio buttons are a type of input. They should all be nested in their own label element. Furthermore, all related radio buttons should have the same name attribute.

Here's an example of a radio button:

    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
