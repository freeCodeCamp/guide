There have been a number of well publicized cases in which software was used to deceive users or even break the law. At the heart of these cases is a breach of ethics on the part of one or more developers. Such cases include:

* <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>**Volkswagon Emission Scandal**</a> – Volkswagen intentionally programmed turbocharged direct injection (TDI) diesel engines to activate some emissions controls only during laboratory emissions testing.
