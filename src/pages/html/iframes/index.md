## Iframes

Iframes are HTML tags that allow you to specify an inline frame. In other words, it allows you to pull content in from another page (on your site or elsewhere) and embed it onto your page. Although you can specify some styles on the frame itself, you can't change the content in the frame or apply styles to that content in the frame. Everything inside the frame is specified and created from the source in which you are embedding from. 

One way to think of an iframe is like a window. You can change the window itself (painting the frame a different colour, for example), but you can't change what you're seeing through the window unless you go to the source of it. Similarly, an iframe is showing you a portion of another document that you can't change unless you have access to that other document. 

A common use of iframes is to embed videos on a page. If you've ever seen a web page with a YouTube video embedded, you are looking at an iframe. The iframe is pulling in a video from YouTube and showing it on your site, however through your site, you can't change that video in any way. Another example of iframe usage is embedding maps onto a page, such as Google Maps.
