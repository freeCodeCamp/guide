# PHP Variables
PHP variables are declared using the dollar ($) sign followed immediately by the variable name. For example, the code block below would create a variable called `myVariable` and assign the string `Hello World` to it. 
``` PHP
$myVariable = "Hello World";
```

## Naming Variables
As with any programming language, PHP has certain rules that apply to naming variables. 

Valid variable names will follow the following rules
- Will start with either a letter or an underscore
- Will contain only letters, numbers, or underscores
- PHP variables are case sensitive, so `$var` , `$Var` and `$VAR` would all be considered different variables

## Predefined Variables
PHP has several special keywords that while are "valid" variable names, cannot be used for your variables. The reason for this is that the language itself has already defined those variables and they have are used for special purposes. Several examples are listed below, for a complete list see the [PHP documentation site](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.predefined.php).
-  `$this`
- `$_GET`
- `$_POST`
- `$_SERVER`
- `$_FILES`

## Assigning Values to Variables
To assign a value to a variable, you simply type the variable followed by the equals operator ( = ) followed by the value. For example
``` PHP
$myVariable = "Hello World";
$number1 = 5;
$number2 = 10;
$total = $number1 + $number2; 
```

You may have noticed several important things about the example above. The first variable I declared it equal to **Hello World**, surrounded by quotation marks. This is because **Hello World** is a string of text and strings must be surrounded by quotation marks. 

The second line I declared `$number1` to be equal to the value of 5. I could have declared `$number1` to be equal to `"5"`, which would tell PHP I want the 5 to be stored as a string, not a actual value. The difference is that you cannot perform calculation (as I did in the 4th line) on strings.

The fourth line I declare `$total` to be equal to the values of `$number1` plus `$number2`. This is called declaring a value by reference. 

## Conclusion
PHP makes it easy to work with variables, and you should think of variables as containers to store information. For even more information check out these resources:
