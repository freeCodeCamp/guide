## Mean, Median, Mode, and Range

Mean, median, and mode are three variations of average. Range is the difference between the largest and smallest values of a set.

```
Example set:

5, -4, 11, 5, 5, 20, 8.5, 11
```

The **mean** of a set of values is the sum of all the values divided by how many values there are.
```
5 + (-4) + 11 + 5 + 5 + 20 + 8.5 + 11 = 61.5

Sum: 61.5
Count: 8

61.5 / 8 = 7.6875

The mean is 7.6875
```

The **median** is the middle value in an ordered set. If the count of values in a set is odd, the median value is simply the middle value. If the count is even, the median value is the mean (average) of the two middle values.

```
First, put the set in order:

-4, 5, 5, 5, 8.5, 11, 11, 20

The third 5 and 8.5 are the middle values...
(5 + 8.5) / 2 = 6.75

The median is 6.75
```
The **mode** is the value that appears most often in a set. If all values appear an equal number of times, there is no mode for that set.

```
Put the set in order so it's easier to see how
many of each value there are:

-4, 5, 5, 5, 8.5, 11, 11, 20

5 appears three times, 11 appears twice and
everything else appears once.

The mode is 5
```
The **range** of a set is calculated by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value.

```
Smallest value: -4
Largest value: 20

20 - (-4) = 24

The range is 24
```
