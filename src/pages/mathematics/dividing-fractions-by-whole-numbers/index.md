## Dividing Fractions by Whole Numbers

Here are the steps to divide a fraction by a whole number

1. Multiply the denominator of the fraction by the whole number. 
2. If possible, simplify the resultant fraction

#### Example 1

<pre>  <span class="fraction"><sup>4</sup>⁄<sub>5</sub></span> &divide; 3 = <span class="fraction"><sup>4</sup>⁄<sub>(3 * 5)</sub></span> = <span class="fraction"><sup>4</sup>⁄<sub>15</sub></span> </pre>

#### Example 2

<pre>  <span class="fraction"><sup>6</sup>⁄<sub>7</sub></span> &divide; 2 = <span class="fraction"><sup>6</sup>⁄<sub>(2 * 7)</sub></span> = <span class="fraction"><sup>6</sup>⁄<sub>14</sub></span> = <span class="fraction"><sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>7</sub></span> (Simplified) </pre>

Please note that a whole number can also be considered as a fraction by considering its denominator as 1. It, then becomes similar to dividing two fractions
