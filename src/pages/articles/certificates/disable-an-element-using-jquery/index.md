title: Disable an Element Using jQuery
---
You can also change the non-CSS properties of HTML elements with jQuery. For example, you can disable buttons.

When you disable a button, it will become grayed-out and can no longer be clicked.

jQuery has a function called `.prop()` that allows you to adjust the properties of elements.

Here's how you would disable all buttons:

    $('#button').prop('disabled', true);
