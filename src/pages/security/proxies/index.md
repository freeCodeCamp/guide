## Proxy

**Introduction**

 - A proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application) that
   acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers.
 - Most proxies are web proxies, facilitating access to content on the
   World Wide Web, providing anonymity and may be used to bypass IP
   address blocking.

**Types of Proxy server**
A proxy server may reside on the user's local computer, or at various points between the user's computer and destination servers on the Internet.

 - A ***proxy server*** that passes unmodified requests and responses is
   usually called a gateway or sometimes a tunneling proxy.
 - A ***forward proxy*** is an Internet-facing proxy used to retrieve from a
   wide range of sources (in most cases anywhere on the Internet).
 - A **reverse proxy** is usually an internal-facing proxy used as a
   front-end to control and protect access to a server on a private network.
 - A ***reverse proxy*** commonly also performs tasks such as load-balancing,
   authentication, decryption or caching.

**Why Proxies?**

 - Monitoring and filtering.
 - Filtering of encrypted data
 - Bypassing filters and censorship
 - Improving performance.

**Common Proxy implementation**
***Tor onion proxy software***:  Tor (short for The Onion Router) is a system intended to enable online anonymity. Tor client software routes Internet traffic through a worldwide volunteer network of servers in order to conceal a user's location or usage from someone conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis.
