## Definition of Mean

In probability and statistics, population mean and expected value are used synonymously to refer to one measure of the central tendency either of a probability distribution or of the random variable characterized by that distribution. In the case of a discrete probability distribution of a random variable X, the mean is equal to the sum over every possible value weighted by the probability of that value; that is, it is computed by taking the product of each possible value x of X and its probability P(x), and then adding all these products together, giving 
```
{\displaystyle \mu =\sum xP(x)} \mu =\sum xP(x)
```
An analogous formula applies to the case of a continuous probability distribution. Not every probability distribution has a defined mean; see the Cauchy distribution for an example. Moreover, for some distributions the mean is infinite: for example, when the probability of the value 
```
{\displaystyle 2^{n}} 2^{n} is {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2^{n}}}} {\tfrac {1}{2^{n}}} for n = 1, 2, 3, ....
