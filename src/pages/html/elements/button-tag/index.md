## Button Tag

Button tag ensures that the user could click whatever the developer wants to be clicked and trigger some event.

```html
<button type="button">Click</button>
```

It is important to use type tag inside button to ensure that all browsers would interpret button correctly.
HTML renders the button in a very simplistic appearance, if you want to make fancier looking buttons, you should look into CSS styling of the buttons.
