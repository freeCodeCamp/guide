## Ruby Hashes

A hash is a collection of key-value pairs, each key being unique. To make a hash in Ruby,
use curly brackets, separate key and associated value with colon, finally separate each pairs with comma:

```ruby
my_hash = { "Jean" => 18, "Maria" => 18, "Simon" => 26 }
```

You can read a value of an hash using its paired key:

```ruby
my_hash["Jean"] #=> 18
```

You can read the key of a specific value using the `.key` method:

```ruby
my_hash.key(26) #=> "Simon"
```
