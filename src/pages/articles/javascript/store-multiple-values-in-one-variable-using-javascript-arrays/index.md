title: Store Multiple Values in One Variable Using JavaScript Arrays
---
With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening bracket, end it with a closing bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

    var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"]

`myArray = [2,'j'];`
