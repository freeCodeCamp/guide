## Doctype Declaration

DOCTYPEs are required for legacy reasons. When omitted, browsers tend to use a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications. Including the DOCTYPE in a document ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications.

> Note:<br>
> ```<!DOCTYPE html>``` is case-insensitively.

## Common Doctype Declarations

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
