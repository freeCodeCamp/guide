## Define a Constructor Function

### Method:

The `Dog()` function should be written in the exact same format as the `Bird()` function given in the example. Simply replace `Bird` with `Dog` to pass all test cases.

### Solution:

```javascript

function Dog() {
  this.name = "Geogre",
  this.color = "White",
  this.numLegs = 4;
}

```
