## The Vertex of a Parabola

The vertex of a parabola is the lowest point or the highest point (if the parabola is upside-down) of the parabola. This is the point where the slope changes from positive to negative or vice versa. For a given quadratic y=ax^2+bx+c, the vertex (h,k) is found by computing h = -b/2a and evaluating y by plugging in h.
