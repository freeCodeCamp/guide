## Java Swing

Let's explore the Java swing tutorial. Before making our hands all dirty with the Swing, it is recommended that you go through the [Abstract Window Toolkit(AWT)](https://www.studytonight.com/java/java-awt.php).Earlier, Swing was added as a part of [Java Foundation Classes(JFC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Foundation_Classes).However it was fully merged into Java from Java 1.2 onwards.

### Strikable features
1. Lightweight components- Since the Swing components are completely written in JAVA,they don't use platform specific resources as like AWT components do.

2. Pluggable Look and Feel(PLAF)- The Look and Feel of component is entirely determined by Swing itself. That makes it easier to distinguish between look and feel and the logic of component.

### Components
An Component is simply an independent visual control.Swing components are derived from JComponent class. Further JComponent inherits all its characteristics from AWT Containers and Components.For more information, please go through the hierarchy of [JComponent](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/jcomponent.html)class.
