Code smell is like a smelly person on the bus. That person is alive and well, but something went a bit wrong (either he/she was too busy to take a shower or ate something horrid and can't contain the gas exhaust). With smelly code everything is working, however there is an underlying problem which slows down the software/app, or make the code overly complicated and thus unreadable. It is important to understand that code smell is not a bug, the person on the bus is still alive, the code is still working but not as well as it could be. 
Code smell can be caused by multiple reasons, but the two main ones are when the knowledge required to write decent code is not present and when the coding happens under pressure where output quantity is more important than quality.
