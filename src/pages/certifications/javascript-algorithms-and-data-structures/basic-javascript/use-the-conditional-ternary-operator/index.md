Hi, I tried solving the challenge with the following code but unfortunately it doesn't pass the tests, although it does so in other console.logs. Could you please tell me where I've gone wrong? Thank you!

```javascript
  function checkEqual(a, b) {
  return (a === b ? "true" : "false");
}
checkEqual(2, 2);
```
