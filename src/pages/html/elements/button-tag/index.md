## Button Tag

The button tag is an essential part of coding any HTML website that features any type of Call To Action (CTA) or action that the user might take. There are many different ways to incorporate a button into your website and they should be used with what best fits your specific situation. We will get into some of the specifics of the button tag.

The button item is a clickable item in HTML. It can be used for a variety of purposes, but some of the most popular include: form submission buttons, CTA buttons (like a Call Now, or Get Started), and to continue on (like a Read More button on a blog post). These are all essential parts of a majority of websites, which makes the button tag vital.

The button tag can be styled like any other element, and often web developers will put an associated JavaScript on click event to trigger some sort of additional action when a user clicks that element. The syntax for a button element is similar to most, `<button>Button Text</button>`. You can apply whatever classes you like, and if you use a CSS framework, like Bootstrap or others, they come with some predefined button styles based on specific classes. 

There are also a number of data attributes that can be added to the button tag. For a full list of attributes, visit the [MDN Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button).
