## Trees

A tree is a nonlinear data structure which organizes data in a hierarchical structure. 

In trees, every individual element is called a node. These nodes store the actual data of the element and a link to the next element in the tree. If a tree has n number of nodes, then the tree can have a maximum n-1 number of links.

Basic terminologies used in a tree data structure
1. Root - the node located on the very top of a tree is called the root.
2. Child - a node below a given node connected by a downward edge.
3. Parent - a node that has a "child".
4. Internal Nodes - are nodes that have "children" nodes. Parent nodes are Internal nodes.
5. External Nodes - also called "leaves", are nodes without children.
6. Edge - is the connection between one node and another.
7. Height
  7.1 Height of a node - the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf.
  7.2 Height of a tree - the height of the root. 
8. Depth - the depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to node.
9. Degree - the number of subtrees of a node.
