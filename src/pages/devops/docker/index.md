## Docker

Docker is an open source project to build, ship and run containers for software applications. Docker implements high-level API to provide lightweight containers that run processes in isolation. This means a single server or virtual machine can run several concurrent containers.
### Features of Docker:
* Fast and consistent delivery of application by streamlining the development lifecycle
* Docker's container-based platform allows for highly portable workload
* Run more workloads on the same server or virtual machine.
* Deliver applications safer across the entire lifecycle with integrated security capabilities.

### What are containers?
Containers are a method of operating system virtualization for running and deploying distributed applications. It is a lightweight piece of software that contains application code and dependencies. It isolates set of resources such as memory, CPU, disk etc, from host and other containers . This operating system virtualization allows quick, reliable and consistent deployment of applications.
