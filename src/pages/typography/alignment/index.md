## Alignment

In Typography, Typesetting and Page Layout, alignment refers to the setting of the text flow or the placement of the image relative to a page, column, table cell, or tab.

The type alignment setting is also referred to as text alignment, text justification, or type justification. The corner or the edge of a page or column is known as margin, and the gap between such columns is known as a gutter.

There are four types of typographic alignments:

### Flush left
When the alignment is set as flush left, the text is aligned along the left margin or gutter. It is also known as left-aligned, ragged right or ranged left.

### Flush right
When the alignment is set as flush right, the text is aligned along the right margin or gutter, also known as right-aligned, ragged left or ranged right.

### Justified
When the alignment is set as justified, the text is aligned along the left margin, and letter- and word-spacing is adjusted so that the text falls flush with both margins, also known as fully justified or full justification.

### Centered
When the alignment is set as centered, the text is aligned to neither the left nor right margin; there is an even gap on each side of each line.
