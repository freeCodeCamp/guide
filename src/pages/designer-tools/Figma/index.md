## Figma

Figma is an interface design tool based in the browser, making it easier for teams to create software. It connects to the cloud, allowing for multiple designers to work on the same project simultaneously.

It has an in-built version control system, like Git, which allows designers to design without the fear of designs being overridden or deleted by fellow team-mates. 

### Why Figma?

* Browser-based
* The desktop app is available for both Mac and Windows (unlike Sketch)
* In-built versioning
* You can import your Sketch files
* Strong Typography and Vector Graphic Tools
* It has a Multiplayer Mode which makes collaboration a breeze

The Figma UI is very easy to use for beginners. If you have been a former Sketch user, you will feel home in no time.
