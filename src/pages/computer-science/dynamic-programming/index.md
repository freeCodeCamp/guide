## Dynamic Programming

### What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic programming is like the Divide-and-conquer method, solves problem by combining the solution to subproblems.In contrast, a dynamic
programming applies when the subproblems subsubproblems.A dynamic-programming algorithms solves each subsubproblems just once and then
saves its answer in a table, thereby avoiding the work of recomputing the answer every time it solves each subsubproblems.
We typically apply dynamic programming to the **Optimization Problems**

### Step to devloping Dynamic Programming Algorithms

* Characterize the structure of an optimal solution
* Recursively define the value of an optimal solution
* Compute the value of an optiaml solution typically in bottom-up approach
* Construct an optimal solution from computed information

### Problems that can be solved in Dynamic Programming 

* Matrix Chain Multiplication
* Longest Common Subsequence
* 0-1 Knapsack
* Subset Sum
* All pair Shortest Path 
* Rod Cutting
