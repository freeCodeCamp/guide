## Acceptance Testing

Acceptance Testing focuses  on checking if the developed software meets all the requirements. Its main purpose is to check if the solution developed meets the user expectations.

It is usually performed by the users or the Subject Matter Experts. it is also called as User Acceptance Testing (UAT). UAT involves most common real life scenarios. Unlike system testing, it does not focus on the errors or crashes, but on the functionality. UAT is done at the end of the testing life-cycle and will decide if the software is moved to the next environment or not.
