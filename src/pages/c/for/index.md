# For Loop

The `for` loop executes a block of code until a specified condition is false. Use `while` loops when the number of iterations are variable, otherwise use `for` loops. A common use of `for` loops are array iterations.

Syntax of For loop in C programming language is-

for ( init; condition; increment ) 
{
   statement(s);
}

Here is the flow of control in a 'for' loop âˆ’

The init step is executed first, and only once. This step allows you to declare and initialize any loop control variables. You are not required to put a statement here, as long as a semicolon appears.

Next, the condition is evaluated. If it is true, the body of the loop is executed. If it is false, the body of the loop does not execute and the flow of control jumps to the next statement just after the 'for' loop.

After the body of the 'for' loop executes, the flow of control jumps back up to the increment statement. This statement allows you to update any loop control variables. This statement can be left blank, as long as a semicolon appears after the condition.

The condition is now evaluated again. If it is true, the loop executes and the process repeats itself (body of loop, then increment step, and then again condition). After the condition becomes false, the 'for' loop terminates.

## Example
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {

    int i;
    int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    	printf("Item on index %d is %d\n", i, array[i]);
    }
}
```

## Output:
```
> Item on index 0 is 1
> Item on index 1 is 2
> Item on index 2 is 3
> Item on index 3 is 4
```
