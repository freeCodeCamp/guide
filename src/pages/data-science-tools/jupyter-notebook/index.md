## What Is A Jupyter Notebook?

In this case, "notebook" or "notebook documents" denote documents that contain both code and rich text elements, such as figures, links, equations. Because of the mix of code and text elements, these documents are the ideal place to bring together an analysis description and its results as well as they can be executed perform the data analysis in real time.

"Jupyter" is a loose acronym meaning Julia, Python, and R. These programming languages were the first target languages of the Jupyter application, but nowadays, the notebook technology also supports many other languages. 
And there you have it: the Jupyter Notebook.

## What does it do? 

As a server-client application, the Jupyter Notebook App allows you to edit and run your notebooks via a web browser. The application can be executed on a PC without Internet access or it can be installed on a remote server, where you can access it through the Internet.

Its two main components are the kernels and a dashboard.

A kernel is a program that runs and introspects the userâ€™s code. The Jupyter Notebook App has a kernel for Python code, but there are also kernels available for other programming languages. The dashboard of the application not only shows you the notebook documents that you have made and can reopen but can also be used to manage the kernels: you can which ones are running and shut them down if necessary.

## Installation
