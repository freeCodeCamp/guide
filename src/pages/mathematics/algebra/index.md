## Algebra

Algebra is a branch of mathematics that substitutes letters for numbers to solve for unknown values. Algebra can include real numbers, complex numbers, matrices, vectors, and many more forms of numerical representations.

In algebra, the manipulation that occurs to the expression on one side of the equal sign also happens to the other. This maintains equality and consistency of the sought-after value.
