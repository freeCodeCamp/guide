## Promises
JavaScript is single threaded, meaning that two bits of script cannot run at the same time; they have to run one after another. A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.

```javascript  
var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  // do thing, thenâ€¦

  if (/* everything worked */) {
    resolve("See, it worked!");
  }
  else {
    reject(Error("It broke"));
  }
});
```

## A Promise exists in one of these states:

  - pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
  - fulfilled: operation completed successfully.
  - rejected: operation failed.

The Promise object works as proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.
