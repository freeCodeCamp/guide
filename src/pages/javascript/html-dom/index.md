## HTML Dom

With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.

When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a **D**ocument **O**bject **M**odel of the page.

The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:

Each element in the DOM is also called a node.

* JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
* JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
* JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
* JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
* JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page
