## Version Control System

Version control is way to keep track of all the files within a project. This includes each iteration (hence 'version') of every file. 

An important part of programming is being able to manage changes. The need arises to be able to manage diverging versions of a single codebase.

There exists different version control systems and a number of unique providers. However, GIT is the one that is the dominant tool. 

It is already very userful to track changes when working on an individual project. When you have deployed your site to the world, additional iterations to that site may have breaking changes. So rather than deploy the broken code to the public site, a better method is to keep those iterations seperate on another branch. Once this iteration is complete it can then be merged into the master branch. 

And this is intensely maginfied when in a team, when more than one developer is working on a single codebase, version control becomes imperative to the clarity and continued progress of a project.
