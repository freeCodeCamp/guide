title: Introducing Else Statements
---
When a condition for an `if` statement is true, the block of code following it is executed. What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen. With an `else` statement, an alternate block of code can be executed.

    if (num > 10) {
      return "Bigger than 10";
    } else {
      return "10 or Less";
    }
