## Buttons
The Bootstrap framework provides you with various styling options for buttons. These styles help you provide a visual representation to the user of what the button may do.

#### How To Use:
To use bootstrap buttons you follow the same steps that you would to create a button in HTML except you also apply the applicable CSS class to the button. A code example has been provided below.

**Code Example:**

`<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>`

<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>

You can also use bootstrap buttons with the `<a>` and `<input>` elements as shown in the examples below.

`<a class="btn btn-primary" href="#" role="button">This button is a link</a>`

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="#" role="button">This button is a link</a>

`<input class="btn btn-primary" type="submit" value="Submit">`

<input class="btn btn-primary" type="submit" value="Submit">

`.btn-xs` This is bootstrap's large button.

<button type="button" class="btn btn-xs">Extra Small</button>

#### Bootstrap Outlined Buttons:
It is possible to also have outlined buttons rather than fully colored in ones. This is achieved by placing the mid fix `outline` between the button class you want. A sample usage would be as follows:

`<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary">Primary</button>`

Outlined buttons are a part of Bootstrap since version 4, please be sure that you are using the right version if you are unable to get them work.

_Note: Do not include the dot in the HTML Class Attribute, referring to the classes with a dot is only used when adjusting the classes in CSS._
