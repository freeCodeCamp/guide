## Trojans

A Trojan Horse, or Trojan, is a malicious computer program that misleads a user as to its actual intent.

Many modern Trojans are spread through social engineering, such as innocuous-looking attachments which are actually executables. Many Trojans will set up backdoors on a victim's computer, allowing their controller access to users' personal information. They may also multiply and spread themselves via the victim's computer.
