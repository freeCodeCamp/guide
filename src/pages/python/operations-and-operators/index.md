title: Python Operations and Operators
---
**Operators** are the constructs which can manipulate the value of operands.

Consider the expression `4 + 5 = 9`. Here, `4` and `5` are called _operands_ and `+` is called _operator_.

## Types of Operator

Python language supports the following types of operators.

*   Arithmetic Operators
*   Comparison (Relational) Operators
*   Assignment Operators
*   Logical Operators
*   Bitwise Operators
*   Membership Operators
*   Identity Operators

## Arithmetic Operators


# Subtraction(-):

Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.

ex: `x = z - y`

If z = 7 and y = 3 , x will become 4 after the operation.

# Addition(+):

Adds values on either side of the operator.

ex: `x = z + y`

If z = 4 and y = 7 , x will become 11 after the operation

# Multiplication(*):

Multiplies values on either side of the operator.

ex: `x = z * y`

If z = 5 and y = 5 , x will become 25 after the operation.

#  Division(/):

Divides left hand operand by right hand operand.

ex: `x = z / y`

if z = 10 and y = 3 , x will become 3.333333 after the operation. 

# Modulus(%):

Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder.

ex: `x = z % y`

If z = 7 and y = 4 , x will become 3 after the operation which is remainder of 7 divided by 4.

#  Exponent(**):

Performs exponential calculation on operators.

ex: `x = z ** y`

If z = 2 and y = 3 , x will become 8 after the operation.

# Floor-Divisoin(//):

The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are removed. But if one of the operands is negative, the result is floored, i.e., rounded away from zero (towards negative infinity).

ex: `x = z // y`

If z = 10 and y = 3 , x will become 3 after the operation which is the floor value of 3.33.
