## Linux

Linux is an open source, unix based operating system created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.  Linux was first started as a clone of the MINIX operating system.  Open source contributors added onto the kernel and expanded its hardware compatability.  Linux's hardware supoort and free licensing made linux a popular choice for desktop and server computing in the mid 90s.  Today, linux is the most popular operating system in the world. It powers 90% of the world's servers, and is the basis of Google's popular Android operating system.


There are also many versions of Linux designed to be run on personal computers, such as Debian or Ubuntu. More importantly, these different versions of Linux (called distributions) allow the user varying degrees of personalization and control of the operating system. This means that users can choose their Linux distributions based on their wants and needs.  


There is also Kali Linux which is used for advanced penetration testing and auditing. It has over 700 tools, to be able to use it efficiently you will need to know how to use command line. It is not advised for beginners.

Distributions of Linux include:

* Ubuntu
* Linux Mint
* CentOS
* RHEL
* Arch Linux

Package types are split between Debian (.deb) and Red Hat (.rpm) and are typical the most commonly used, however there are others including Pacman (used for Arch Linux) and PetGet (Puppy Linux).

Linux distributions also come in all shapes and size and most if not all offer the ability to run directly via CD / DVD in what's known as a 'Live CD' environment or even directly via USB if your motherboard supports booting from USB.
