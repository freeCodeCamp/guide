Itertools is a python module of functions that return generators, objects that only function when iterated over. 
Some examples of itertool functions include but not limited to: chain(), imap(), product(), and compress().

```py
import itertools
a = itertools.chain([1, 2], [3, 4])

# Output
# [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
