#### Introduction

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.
 
 Declaration in HTML 5 -
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 
 #### Rememeber
 The 'doctype' tag does not need any closing tag as required by <html> and <body> tags.

#### Tip-
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is NOT case sensitive.
Thanks!!
