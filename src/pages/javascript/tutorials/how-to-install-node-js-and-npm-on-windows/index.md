## How to Install Node Js and Npm on Windows
To install Node Js and Npm on Windows, head over to the [official site](https://nodejs.org/en/), there are 2 big links to the 2 main versions of node:
![node versions](https://github.com/ZaninAndrea/FCCGuidesImages/blob/master/node.PNG?raw=true)
- **LTS**: This is the stable version that will be supported (bugs will be fixed) for a long time. Choose this version if you are not experienced or if you are developing key software for your company
- **Current**: This is the version with all the lastest, coolest features, but you are not guaranteed that things will not break (although it's very unlikely). Choose this version if you know what you are doing or if you want to tinker with the latest tech

Once downloaded the installer run it and follow the instructions, you can now call `node` and `npm` from terminal
