## Link Tag

The **`<link>`** tag is used to define a connection between external ressources and your html-page.
It is also used to embedd external css stylesheets.

Since it is an attribute only tag it does not have an closing tag.
You need to use **`<link>`** in __`<head>`__ sections.
## Example for linking CSS
```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
```

## Example for linking a Google Font (Roboto)
```html
<head>
  <link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
</head>
```

The __`<link>`__ tag is supported by every major browser.
