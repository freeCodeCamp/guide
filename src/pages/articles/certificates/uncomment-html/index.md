title: Uncomment HTML
---
Comments allow code to be ignored. In the HTML language, comments are done by wrapping the code you wish to ignore with `<!-- and -->`

    <!-- This text would not show up as it is a comment -->

You can easily uncomment by just removing the comment elements.

**_Note:_** Be careful when uncommenting HTML to remove both the beginning and end portions of the comment!

**_Note:_** Comments might be done differently in other languages such as JavaScript, but the general concept of removing whatever marks a comment applies.
