Reinforcement Learning refers to a field of Machine Learning that applies to agents that you reinforce by giving them reward and punishment. It gives a nice gradual learning and can simplify the learning of agent in tasks where you cannot determine a proper error value.

Example:
A bot is given task to play Space Invaders, it tries to learn to play it by interacting with game and in return getting a reward for the points that it scored at end of game. Greater the reward, greater are its chances of doing the similar gameplay.
