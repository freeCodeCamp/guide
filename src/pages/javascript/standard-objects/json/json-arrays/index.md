## JSON Arrays

JSON Arrays are no different from normal array object that you use in Javascript. Its an array object which contains multiple `JSON Objects`.

Here is an example of a JSON Array:

```Javascript
    var aMyPlaylist = [{
        artist: "Ed Sheeran",
        track: "Supermarket flowers",
        myRating: 10
    }, {
        artist: "Tracy Chapman",
        track: "Fastcar",
        myRating: 9
    }];
```

This is an JSON Array named as `aMyPlaylist`. All array methods like `map`, `filter`, `sort` etc. can be applied on any JSON Array as well
