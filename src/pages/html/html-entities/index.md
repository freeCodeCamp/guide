## HTML Entities

An entity is a string that begins with the ampersand (`&`) and ends with a semicolon (`;`). Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). You can also use them in place of other characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard. 

#### Examples

| Entity    | Character |
| --------- | --------- |
|`&#x02713;`| &#x02713; |
|`&#9742;`  | &#9742;   |
