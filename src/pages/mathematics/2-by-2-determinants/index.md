## 2 by 2 Determinants

In linear algebra, the determinant of a two-by-two matrix is a useful quantity. Scientists, engineers, and mathematicians use determinants in many everyday applications including image and graphic processing. 

Calculating the determinant of a square two-by-two matrix is simple, and is the basis of the [Laplace formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_expansion) used for calculating determinants for larger square matrices.

Given a matrix A, the determinant of A (written as |A|) is given by the following equation:
