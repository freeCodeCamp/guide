## Algorithms

An algorithm is like a recipe. It's a series of steps one takes to achieve a specific outcome.

Some common types of algorithms include sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and compression algorithms. Classes of algorithms include Graph, Dynamic Programming, Sorting, Searching, Strings, Math, Computational Geometry, Optimization, Miscellaneous. Although technically not a class of algorithms, Data Structures is often grouped with them. 

### Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms comes in various flavors depending on your necessity.
Some, very common and widely used are:

#### Quick Sort

There is no sorting discussion which can finish without quick sort. Basic idea is in link below.

freeCodeCamp's curriculum heavily emphasizes creating algorithms. This is because learning algorithms is a good way to practice programming skills. Interviewers most commonly test candidates on algorithms during developer job interviews.
