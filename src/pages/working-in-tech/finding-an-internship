If you are a current student, looking for an internship, the process might be slightly different than the way in which you would approach 
finding a full-time job. First, review your resume, and prepare for interviews (Try reading Cracking the coding interview (book)). 
Attend any job fairs your university has, and if they do not have any, check with neighboring universities and attend their career fairs. 
Look for internships online, or through  your school's recruitment platform (this second option is preferred as your resume is more likely
to stand out from the crowd). Try reaching out to family, friends, and alumni in the tech field to discuss passing along your resume to the 
hiring department.

Happy Internship Hunting!
