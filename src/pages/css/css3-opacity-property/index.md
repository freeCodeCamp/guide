## CSS3 Opacity Property

The CSS `opacity` property controls the level of transparency of an element, on a scale of between `0` and `1`.

By default, all elements have and `opacity` of `1` which makes them completely opaque (not see-through), but you can edit this by lowering the value, e.g: 
```css
div#slightly-transparent {
    opacity:0.75;
}
```
