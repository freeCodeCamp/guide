Tree is a very useful datastructure where the elements appear in a non-linear fashion, which requires a 2-dimensional representation.
Basic terminologies in Tree are:
1) Node - This is the main component of any tree structure. The concept of the node is same as that used in a linked list. A node of a tree stores the actual data and linkd to the other node.
2) Parent - The parent of a node is the immediate predecessor of a node.
3) Child - If the immediate predecessor of the node is the parent of the node then all immediate successors of a node are known as child.
4) Link - This is a pointer to a node in a tree.
5) Root - This is a specially designed node which has no parent.
6) Leaf - The node which is at the end and doesnot have any child is called leaf node. A leaf node is also altrernatively termed terminal node.
7) Height - The maximum number of nodes that is possible in the path that is starting from the root node to a leaf node is called the height of a tree.
8) Degree - The maximum number of children that is possible for a node is known as the degree of a node.
9) Sibling - The nodes which have the same parent are called siblings.
