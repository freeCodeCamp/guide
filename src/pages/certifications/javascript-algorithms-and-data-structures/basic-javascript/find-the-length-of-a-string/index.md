## Find the Length of a String

Strings have an <strong>attribute</strong> (feature) called 'length'. All you have to do is tag it after the string / variable.

    var str1 = "Hello";
    var length1 = str1.length; // This returns 5
 
    var length2 = " Camper".length; // This returns 7 because the space is counted as one character.
