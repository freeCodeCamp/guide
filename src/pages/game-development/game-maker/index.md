## Game Development with Game Maker

Game Maker is a cross-platform game engine developed by Yoyo Games, which is primarily used to develop video games and simulations for computers, consoles and mobile devices.

## Overview

Game Maker was developing with people who were not programmers in mind, having as the greatest feature the "Drag 'n' Drop" method for
creating logic loops, physics, score count, graphic manipulation, between many other functions available without a single line of writing
from the user. Even though, Yoyo Games developed a unique programming language called Game Maker Language (GML), wich was completelly
optional, but had many great features and flexibility that were not available trough D'n'D (short for drag and drop).

Many Sucessfull cases of game development using Game Maker are available in the industry, like Hotline Miami,  Nuclear
Throne, Undertale and Hyper Light Drifter.
