## What is an API

An API is an **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface. That is, it allows you to interact with an application and 
its data.

The way you use APIs is through HTTP requests. You can add, retrieve, delete or update data on an API through them.

APIs are at the core of all services which require some sort of external data. The majority of APIs used by developers are
web APIs, which are provided by web services. 

Single-page apps or progressive web apps are mostly powered by some sort of APIs. 

APIs store data in either XML or JSON formats.
