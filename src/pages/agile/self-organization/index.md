## Self Organization

In order to maintain high dynamics and agility of developed projects, all team members should mindfully share responsibility for product that is being developed.

Vertically oriented organisational structures proved themself to be slow and inflexible with many levels of decision making. If team wants to act fast and react dynamically to constantly changing environment, the organisationa structure needs to be flat with members feeling strongly responsible for their input into the project.
