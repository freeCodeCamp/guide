## Trojans

Trojans are programs or software that mislead the user as to their true purpose. They are often malicious or harmful.

An example is a program you download from the internet which claims to be an image editor but in reality, whenever you open it, malware is spread on your computer.

Trojans can go unnoticed on your computer for a long time, and while present may:
+ Spy on you by sending your information to another computer;
+ Use your computer for malicious purposes such as contributing to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack;
+ Create further loopholes in your security so other malware can also infect your computer; and
+ Use up valuable disk space and generally slow down your computer.

#### Importance for developers
As a developer it is particularly important to be aware of Trojans and how they spread. Trojans are often installed through "drive-by-downloads" on legitimate websites. If the attacker gains access to the hosting environment of your website they can make subtle changes to your code that cause the Trojan to be automatically downloaded by your website visitors.

#### Preventing infection
In order to remain safe from Trojans, you should:
+ Always download programs from reputable websites;
+ Install software and system updates regularly;
+ Keep your anti-virus program up to date and ensure it is scanning regularly; and
+ Do not use the administrator or root account of your computer unless required for installing software or performing updates.
