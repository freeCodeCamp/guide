## Color Theory

Color Theory is a practical application of mixing colors and using color to achieve a specific visual effect.

Colors are used in all sorts of ways.
The choice of colors in visual display is often constrained by hardware, software running on the hardware, limitations of the human eye and variations on how humans perceive color.
Limits to choices are also shaped by artificial constraints supplied by a project, such as having to conform to design style and branding.

Using color theory can help meet the requirements of projects while maximizing legibility of text and accessibility of content to viewers with different viewing traits or needs.

### Color Wheel or Color Picker

A color wheel or picker is a tool used by designers to specify or locate color.
Color wheels can include a color spectrum or they can be organized by a defined categories of light, such as brightness and hue.

**Primary Colors:**

In art and illustration, colors are traditionally separated into three categories: Primary Colors, Secondary Colors, and Tertiary Colors.
Primary colors are colors that cannot be mixed or formed by any combination of other colors.
Secondary colors are the ones formed by mixing two of the primary colors.
Tertiary colors are the ones formed by mixing all three primary colors.

In traditional painting, the colors are red, yellow and blue.
All other colors are derived from these three.
The actual hue of each primary color affects the range of colors available.

Computer visual displays commonly use a different set of three primary colors to approximate color: red, green and blue.
Every color displayed is made of varying the brightness of the primary colors.

Computer printers commonly use four primary colors to represent color.
A black is sometimes used as a contrast medium to increase the range of contrast. Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (CMYK) is a common primary color set.
"Key" represents black.

### Web colors

Web standards including html, css, and graphics file formats: jpg, png, gif, and svg use primary colors of Red, Green, and Blue.
Each technology or device has a slightly different hue of primary color.
For example, a pure red on one monitor may look more pink or orange on another.
These variances add to the complexity of attempting to portray accurate colors on a computer screen.
This is a significant issue, for example, when a consumer seeks a product with a specific color hue.

In web design and human-computer interface heuristics, colors also carry with them cultural connotations and implications.

These that need to be understood or else you could cause confusion. The color red in a non-digital space, such as a fast-food restaurant, carries the implication of energy or excitement. However, on the web the color red also carries with it the implication that the user has committed an error. This example of how color means certain things in certain settings should be a critical reminder to understand how the person viewing your page will interpret the color selection you’ve made.

The overall experience a person has when viewing your page is also determined by the color selection you’ve made. For example, using light-gray or yellow color text on a white background makes it very tough for most people to read. This is due to a lack of contrast between the colors. Black text on a white background or white text on a blue background conversely has high contrast and will be easier to read.

Individuals who are affected by color-blindness might not be able to differentiate between similar colors as easily as you either. What you perceive as a wonderful palette of greens and blues might appear gray, beige, and dull to someone else. Importantly, if you choose a text color that views well for you, it might have much lower contrast than you realize to someone else, making it harder to understand the content you are trying to display.
