## Manipulate Arrays With shift()

While `pop()` was used to get rid of the last element of an array, `shift()` is used to get rid of the first element. It's like you are shifting the elements down one position. Check this out:

```javascript
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr.shift(); // Gets rid of the 1
```
