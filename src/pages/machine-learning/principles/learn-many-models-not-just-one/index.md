Learning and making use of only one Machine Learning Model, isn't enough and doesn't do justice to the project you're working on. 
Having an adequate knowledge as to which machine learning model to use is of crucial importance. Take for example, a data that involves dealing with a Time Series trends. 
In such situations, algorithms that you might consider good enough may fail miserably and the one's you never though of, might work wonderfully; all due to the unpredictable nature of Time Series data that depends of more than one prime factors.
In essence, knowing and making use of multiple models might increase the chance of building an appropriate system.
