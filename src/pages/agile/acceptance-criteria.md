## Acceptance Criteria

The User Story, as an item in your backlog, is a placeholder for a conversation. In this conversation,
the Product Owner and the Delivery Team reach an understanding on the desired outcome.

The Acceptance Criteria tells the Delivery Team how the code should behave. Avoid writing the **"How"** of the User Story; keep to the **"What"**.
If the team is following Test Driven Development (TDD), it may provide the framework for the automated tests.
The Acceptance Criteria will be the beginnings of the test plan for the QA team.

Most importantly, if the story does not meet each of the Acceptance Criteria, then the Product Owner should not be accepting the story at the end of the iteration.
