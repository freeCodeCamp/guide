## Definition of Mode
<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->

The mode is the number which appears most in a set of numbers. In statistics, it is the value which takes the maximum value in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>probability mass function</a> (i.e. the value that is most likely to be sampled).

For example, in <span class="texhtml">{ 3, 2, 5, 5, 4, 1, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 7, 3 }</span>, 3 is the mode.

The mode is not necessarily unique.

For example, in <span class="texhtml">{ 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 5, 6 }</span>, 1, 2, and 5 are all the modes.
