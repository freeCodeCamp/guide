## Ddos Denial of Service Attacks

<p> A denial of service(DOS) attack is when the attacker attempts to disrupt the services of a server by bombarding it with multiple fake requests and preventing actual users from accessing the service. A Distributed DOS attack is when the attack happens from multiple locations at once, making it much more difficult for the cyber-security team to detect and handle the attack.</p>

<p> Ddos attacks are usually targeted at huge corporations where the denial of a service for a few minutes can translate to millions of dollars lost.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Ddos attacks and the best attack is determined by examining the vulnerabilites of the target. </p>
