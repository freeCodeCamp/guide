# Strings

Strings are sequences of characters. In Java, a `String` is an `Object`. Strings should not be confused with `char` as characters are literally 1 value rather than a sequence of characters. You can still use 1 value within a String, however it is preferred to use `char` when you are checking for 1 character.

```java
String course = "FCC";
System.out.println(course instanceof Object);
```

Output:
```
true
```

You can create a String Object in the following ways:

1. `String str = "I am a String"; //as a String literal`
1. `String str = "I am a " + "String"; //as a constant expression`
1. `String str = new String("I am a String"); //as a String Object using the constructor`

You might be thinking: What's the difference between the three?

Well, using the `new` keyword gurantees that a new `String` object will be created and a new memory location will be allocated in the `Heap` memory [(click here to learn more)](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13150_01/jrockit_jvm/jrockit/geninfo/diagnos/garbage_collect.html). String literals and constant String expressions are cached at compile time. The compiler puts them in the String Literal Pool to prevent duplicates and improve memory consumption. Object allocation is expensive and this trick increases performance while instantiating Strings. If you use the same literal again, the JVM uses the same object. Using the contructor like above is almost always a worse choice.

In this code snippet, how many String objects are created?

```java
String str = "This is a string";
String str2 = "This is a string";
String str3 = new String("This is a string");
```


The answer is: 2 String objects are created.  
`str` and `str2` both refer to the same object. `str3` has the same content but using `new` forced the creation of a new, distinct, object.
When you create a String literal, the JVM internally checks, what is known as the `String pool`, to see if it can find a similar (content wise) String object. If it finds it, it returns the same reference. Otherwise, it just goes ahead and creates a new String object in the pool so that the same check can be performed in the future.


You can test this using the swallow, fast Object comparison `==` and the implemented `equals()`.

```java
System.out.println(str == str2); // This prints 'true'
System.out.println(str == str3); // This prints 'false'
System.out.println(str.equals(str3)); // This prints 'true'
```

#### Comparing Strings 
If you want to compare the value of two String variables, you can't use ==. This is due to the fact that this will compare the references of the variables and not the values that are linked to them. To compare the stored values of the Strings you use the method equals.

```java
boolean equals(Object obj)
```

It returns true if two objects are equal and false otherwise. 
```java
String str = "Hello world";
String str2 = "Hello world";

System.out.println(str == str2); // This prints false
System.out.println(str.equals(str2); // This prints true
```
The first comparison is false because "==" looks at the references and they aren't the same.
The second comparison is true because the variables store the same values. In this case "Hello world".

**Notes**

1. String methods use zero-based indexes, except for the second argument of substring().
2. The String class is final- it's methods can't be overridden.
3. When the String literal is found by JVM, it is added to string literal pool.
4. String class contains a method name length(),while arrays have an attribute naming length.
5. Strings are immutable and can not be changed.
