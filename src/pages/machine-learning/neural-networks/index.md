## Neural Networks

A artificial neural network is a computing system. They are like biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. 
To train a neural network, we need an input vector and a corresponding output vector.
The training works by minimizing an error term. This error can be the squared difference between the predicted output and the original output.

The most basic element of a neural network is a neuron. Its input is a vector, say `x`, and its output is a real valued variable, say `y`. Thus, the neuron acts as a mapping between the vector `x` and a real number `y`.

Neural networks are used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, translation, social network filtering, playing video games, and medical diagnosis.

### Visualization

There's an awesome tool to help you grasp the idea of neural networks without any hard math: <a href='http://playground.tensorflow.org' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>TensorFlow Playground</a>, a web app that lets you play with a real neural network running in your browser and click buttons and tweak parameters to see how it works.
