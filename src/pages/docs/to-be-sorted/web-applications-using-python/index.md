Highly popular sites like [YouTube](http://highscalability.com/youtube-architecture), [Reddit](https://github.com/reddit/reddit), [Instagram](http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/13649370142/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances), [Quora](http://qr.ae/RUkZJd), [Pinterest](http://qr.ae/RUkZOJ), [Dropbox](http://eranki.tumblr.com/post/27076431887/scaling-lessons-learned-at-dropbox-part-1), [Bitbucket](https://blog.bitbucket.org/2012/08/24/segregating-services/) etc. are written mostly in Python. You would probably get a more comprehensive list by investigating on your own.

Obviously, the above list is not a complete one; but this would be a great time to point something out to you - writing your back-end in Python would not _automatically_ make your site as fast and scalable as YouTube. We cite the list of sites above to simply point out that Python is a favorite of many software engineers in the industry, for web-development.

Python gives you the lego blocks to build robust, scalable web applications. You also get to enjoy the ease of writing Python modules while building it. But a weapon is only as potent as its master. If you don't know how to wield it, you would end up probably shooting yourself in the foot.
