## Doctype

The doctype should be specified at the top of all HTML documents and its sole purpose is to prevent the browser from rendering the page incorrectly or in a way that wasn't intended. When the doctype is specified the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications.


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

Above you can see an example of an HTML5 doctype. Even though it appears to be a standard HTML tag it actually is not, it's a direct instruction to the web browser specifying what version of HTML the page is written in.
