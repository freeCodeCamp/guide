## HTML Entities
<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.
Characters that are not present on your keyboard can also be replaced by entities.

Some characters are reserved in HTML.
If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.
Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.
A character entity looks like this:
```
&entity_name;
OR
&#entity_number;
```
To display a less than sign (<) we must write: `&lt;` or `&#60;`

**Advantage of using an entity name:** An entity name is easy to remember.
**Disadvantage of using an entity name:** Browsers may not support all entity names, but the support for numbers is good.
