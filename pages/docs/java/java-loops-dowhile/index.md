The `do..while` loop is a special case of the `while` loop wherein the group of statements is guranteed to run atleast once before checking for a given condition. Confused? Ok, the follwing example should clear things up.

        System.out.println("The value of i is " + i);
        i--;
    }while( i >= 10 );
