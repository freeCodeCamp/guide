## Algorithms

An algorithm is like a recipe. It's a series of steps one takes to achieve a specific outcome.

Some common types of algorithms include sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and compression algorithms. 

freeCodeCamp's curriculum heavily emphasizes creating algorithms. This is because learning algorithms is a good way to practice programming skills. Interviewers most commonly test candidates on algorithms during developer job interviews.

This video demonstrates some popular sorting algorithms that are commonly taught in programming and Computer Science courses.
