## Variables

A variable associates a name with a value of a particular type.

#### Example:
```swift
    var welcomeMessage = "Hello"
```

You declare variables with the `var` keyword then give them a name `welcomeMessage` then you use an assignment operator `=` to assign the value `"Hello"` to the variable `welcomeMessage`.

Once you have declared a variable you don't need to use the `var` keyword anymore you just call it by its name.

As the name suggests variables can be changed in the future.

#### Example:
```swift
    welcomeMessage = "Bonjour!"
```
