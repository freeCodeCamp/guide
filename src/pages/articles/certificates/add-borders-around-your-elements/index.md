title: Add Borders Around Your Elements
---
CSS borders have attributes like `style`, `color` and `width`.

For example, if we wanted to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element, we could use this class:

    <style> .thin-red-border { border-color: red; border-width: 5px; border-style: solid; } </style>
