## TypeScript

### Overview

So as you are most likely aware, JavaScript is expanding its footprint everyday and it is both overwhelming and amazing what you can do with the language nowadays.

However, as more large-scale projects start to use JavaScript, the process of making the code easier to write and more maintainable becomes more and more difficult.

This is a problem Microsoft recognized early on and they came up with the solution of TypeScript and released the first version approximately on October 1st, 2012.

You can learn more about the syntax differences at [`TypeScript`](./) > [`JavaScript vs TypeScript`](./javascript-vs-typescript).

In essence, TypeScript is trying to help JavaScript reach new heights and become very scalable and can be highlighting by the following features:

- free and open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft
- strict syntactical super-set of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- eases development of large scale applications written in JavaScript
- extends JavaScript by adding static types, classes, modules, interfaces and generics

**ðŸŽ‰ FUN FACT** TypeScript turned 5 years old on October 1st, 2017.
