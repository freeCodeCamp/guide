## The Quadratic Formula

This is a simple formula we can get by solving the basic representation of a quadratic equation for x:

          ax^2 + bx + c = 0

where a, b, c are the coefficient placeholders (or the constants in a real equation)
and x is the variable for which the value needs to be found.

Solving for x, we get the quadratic formula as:

        x = (-b +- sqroot(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)

This is represented in a more **clear** way here:

### Implications of the formula on finding solutions:

Just by a glance, we can conclude a few statements for any quadratic equation in Real Number Domain and Range:

Consider the expression under the sqare root " b^2 - 4ac " as E

1. If E is positive, then we will have 2 solutions for x (property of squares)
2. If E is zero, then there is one and only one solution for x
3. If E is negative, then there is no **real** solution for x
