## Accessibility
<strong>Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web</strong>.

More specifically, Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and that they can  contribute to the Web. Web accessibility also benefits others, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/soc.html#of" shape="rect">older people</a> with changing abilities due to aging.

Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that  affect access to the Web, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities. The document "<strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/Overview.html" shape="rect">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a></strong>" describes how different disabilities affect Web use and includes scenarios of people with disabilities using the Web.

Web accessibility  also <strong>benefits</strong> people <em>without</em> disabilities. For example, a key  principle of Web accessibility is designing Web sites and software that are flexible to meet different user needs, preferences, and situations. This <strong>flexibility</strong> also benefits people <em>without</em> disabilities in certain situations, such as people using a slow Internet connection, people with "temporary disabilities" such as a broken arm, and people with changing abilities due to aging. The document "<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/Overview" shape="rect">Developing a    Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization</a>" describes  many different benefits of Web accessibility, including <strong>benefits for organizations</strong>.

The use of images and graphics on websites can decrease accessibility for those with visual impairments. However, this doesn't mean designers should avoid using these visual elements. When used correctly, visual elements can convey the appropriate look and feel to users without disabilities and should be used to do so. In order to use these elements appropriately, web designers must use alt text to communicate the message of these elements to those who cannot see them. Alt text should be short and to the point--generally <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/writing-great-alt-text-3466185" shape="rect">no more than five to 15 words</a>. If a graphic is used to convey information that exceeds the limitations of alt text, that information should also exist as web text in order to be read by screen readers.  <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/" shape="rect">Learn more about alt text</a>.
