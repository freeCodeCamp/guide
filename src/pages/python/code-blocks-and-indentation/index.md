title: Python Code Blocks and Indentation
---
It is generally good practice for you not to mix tabs and spaces when coding in Python. Doing this can possibly cause a ```TabError```, and your program will crash. Be consistent when you code - choose either to indent using tabs or spaces and follow your chosen convention throughout your program.

**TODO: NOTE**

*   Should this go here? What should be discussed at this point?
*   Might be more suited for when functions are introduced.
