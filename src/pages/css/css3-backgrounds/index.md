## CSS3 Backgrounds

The CSS `background` shorthand property is used to define multiples properties like :

`background-color`, `background-image`, `background-repeat`, `background-attachment` and `background-position`

### Background Color

The `background-color` property specifies the background color of an element.

```css
   background-color : #F00;
```

### Background Image

The `background-image` property specifies an image to use as background of an element.
By default, the image repeat itself to covers the entire surface of the element.

```css
   background-image: url("GitHub-Mark.png");
```

### Background Image - Repetition

By default, the `background-image` property repeats on the X and Y axis.
If you want to set an axis, like X axis, use `background-repeat` property type:

```css
   background-image: url("GitHub-Mark.png");
   background-repeat: repeat-x;
```

But sometimes you don't want to have your background on all the surface, you've to specify it by typing:

```css
   background-image: url("GitHub-Mark.png");
   background-repeat: no-repeat;
```

### Background Image - Position

You can specify the position of the background by typing : 

```css
   background-image: url("GitHub-Mark.png");
   background-repeat: no-repeat;
   background-position : left bottom;
```

It will set you background at the bottom left of the element.

### Background Image - Fixed Position

If you want to have a background image which will not scroll with the rest of the page, you can use `background-attachement` property:

```css
   background-image: url("GitHub-Mark.png");
   background-repeat: no-repeat;
   background-position: left bottom;
   background-attachment: fixed;
```

### Shorthand property

You can pass all the properties in one super-property `background` :

```css
   background: #F00 url("GitHub-Mark.png") no-repeat fixed left bottom;
```

When you use the shorthand property, you have to respect this order:

1. Background color
2. Background image
3. Background repeat
4. Background attachment
5. Background position

It doesn't matter if one property is missing, as long as you respect the order:

```css
   background: url("GitHub-Mark.png") no-repeat left bottom;
```

This will work even if the color and the attachment are missing.
