## Span Tag

The `<span>` is very useful at the time to add some specific elements in the document. It doesn't offer any visual change and when it comes to styling, the manipulation could be done with HTML, CSS, Javascript or jQuery.

### Example
```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>The Span Tag</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      <p>This is a normal paragraph without any changes.</p>
      <p>This paragraph has <span style="color:red">red span styling</span> inside it without affect the rest of the document</p>
    </div>
  </body>  
</html>
```

#### Differences between <span> and <div>
Using `<div>` and `<span>` could at first sight not make big differences but when it comes to tags and SEO issues, `<div>` is preferred to use between containers and paragraphs. Meanwhile, `<span>` is preferred to use inside the element.
