## Eulers Formula

Eulers Formula is a mathematical identity which states that (for any value of x):
 e^(ix)=cosx+isinx
 
This is of interest because of the following case: 
When x=pi, Euler's Formula gives the beautiful identity invovling pi, e, and i.

 e^(ipi)+1=0, 

A famous joke for mathematicians is "How many mathematicians does it take to change a light bulb?" and answers "-e^(ipi)" 
Can you tell what the answer is?
