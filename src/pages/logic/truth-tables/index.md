## Truth Tables

A truth table is a mathematical tool used in Boolean Algebra. It consists of a column each for the function variables. A final column holds the functional value evaluated for the corresponding values of the variables. 

For a boolean function of n varibles, its truth table expansion will have 2^n rows. This is beacuse each variable has two possible states – true & false.

#### Truth table for the AND operator :

| x | y | x AND y  |
|---|---|---|
| F  | F  | F  |
| F  | T  | F  |
| T  | F  | F  |
| T  | T  | T  |

AND is a binary operator. It operates on two variables, say `x`, `y`. 

Thus we have 2^2 = 4 columns in our truth table !

The last column is the functional value – x AND y.

Truth tables are a powerful tool. They can be used to express & evaluate simple boolean functions and operations as well complex combinational circuits and sequential logic circuits !

Similarly, for other logical operators, the truth tables are as follows.

#### Truth table for OR operator:

| x | y | x OR y  |
|---|---|---|
| F  | F  | F  |
| F  | T  | T  |
| T  | F  | T  |
| T  | T  | T  |

#### Truth table for NOT operator:

| x | NOT x |
|---|---|
| T  | F  |
| F  | T  |

#### Truth table for XOR operator:

| x | y | x XOR y  |
|---|---|---|
| F  | F  | F  |
| F  | T  | T  |
| T  | F  | T  |
| T  | T  | F  |
