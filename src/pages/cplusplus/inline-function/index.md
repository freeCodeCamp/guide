# Inline Function

## Introduction
Inline function is a special function defined in C++ and is expanded inline when it is called.

Now, what does that exactly mean? 

Whenever a function is called it takes a lot of extra time for performing series of activities such as jumping to the function, saving registers, pushing arguments into stack and returning to the calling function. So it takes a lot of time. But an inline function is a function in which the compiler has been requested to perform inline expansion. Where the function requests the compiler to insert the complete body of the function in every place that the function is called, rather than generating code to call the function in the one place it is defined.

However, we cannot guarantee that every function declared inline will be inline. Because when we declare a function as `inline`, it is a request, not a command. Compiler may ignore the request of inlining in the following situations:-
1) If the function contains loop e.g `for` loop, `while` loop, `do-while` loop etc.
2) If the function contains a `switch` or `goto` statement.
3) If the function doesn't return anything even if return type (other than `void` of course) is mentioned.
4) If the function contains a static variable.
5) If the function contains a recursive call.

``` c++
syntax :-
---------
inline return_type function_name(argument_list){

  // function body
  
}
```
## When to use Inline function

* When the function performs small tasks and is called very often.
* When performance is important.
* Instead of a macro.

``` c++
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

class MathOperation{

  public:
  
    inline int add(int x, int y){
    
      return(x+y);
    }
    
    inline float div(int n1, float n2){
    
      return(n1/n2);
    }
};

int main(){

  MathOperation obj;
  
  cout << "Addition is :" << obj.add(34,12) << <"\n";
  cout << "Division is :" << obj.div(12,3.4) << "\n";
  
  return 0;
  
}
```
## Advantages of Inline function
* It saves the overhead of return call from a function.
* It increases locality of reference by utilizing instruction cache.
* It speeds up your program by avoiding function call overheads.
* It saves overhead of variables push/pop operations on the stack, when function calls happen.
* It is possible to put a function definition in a header file, i.e. it can be included in multiple compilation unit, without the linker complaining.

## Disadvantages of inline function
* When used in a header, it makes your header file larger with information which users donâ€™t care.
* It increases the executable size due to code expansion. 
* C++ inlining is resolved at compile time. Which means if you change the code of the inlined function,
you would need to recompile all the code using it to make sure it will be updated.
* As mentioned above it increases the executable size, which may cause thrashing in memory. 
More number of page fault, bringing down your program performance.
