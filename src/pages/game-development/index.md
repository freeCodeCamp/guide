## Game Development

Game development refers to a subset of software development that is tasked with creating games, simulations, and other immersive software experiences. Game developers follow standard software development practices, but place a higher emphasis on graphics programming, hardware performance, sound design, and realtime networking.

Games can be both a creative outlet and a source for huge profits, so the multibillion-dollar industry and the love of the interactive medium attracts programmers, artists, writers, designers, and musicians to the field. Despite the variety of talent and the presence of huge corporate players in the space, the audience and apetite for games is large enough that solo developers can become successful with unique 'indie' offerings.
