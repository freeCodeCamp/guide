### Step 1) Join our [Earth-wide freeCodeCamp Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/freeCodeCampEarth/).

### Step 2) Find your city on the list below of more than 1,000 local groups.

### Step 3) Join your local Facebook group.

If you didn't see your city on our list of groups below, and you are willing to lead a Facebook group for your city, here's how to [create your own Local Group](http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/how-to-create-a-local-group-for-your-city/19532).

Please note that all local groups are unofficial and run independently by members of freeCodeCamp's community. These local groups are not affiliated with the organization that hosts freecodecamp.com, Free Code Camp, Inc, which does not control or endorse what local group members and organizers do on their own.
