## Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. Some examples can be found at the end of this article.

Inside a Jupyter Notebook, one is able to use the technique of literate programming, proposed by Donald E. Knuth, which, in summary, implies that logial code written in any programming language can be mixed with natural language, even if written in languages that are not natural (as markdown or LaTeX).
