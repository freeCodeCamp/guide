title: Change the Font Size of An Element
---
Font size is controlled by the `font-size` CSS attribute, like this: `h1 { font-size: 30px; }`.

px is a unit that stands for [pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel)

Although this Challenge requires the use of px, there are [other units of size measurements used](http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/units.en.html)
