## IDE Integrated Development Environments

**IDE** or Integrated Development Environment is a type of computer program which is used to make software. Usually all the components needed for software development are contained in this one program, allowing for faster development.  

In general, an **IDE** may contain a compiler, interpreter, or both.  However, some IDEâ€™s do not contain either of those components. Most **IDEs** tend to have built in version control systems such as Git which is accessed using a GUI (graphic user interface). 
Many modern **IDE's** also have a class browser, an object browser, and a class hierarchy diagram, for use in object-oriented software development.

Here are some examples of **IDE** programs which are free and most of which are open source. The languages they are used in are listed to next to them. :smiley: Shown below in no particular order :sparkles:
1. [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) - Java, C/C++, PHP, and Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java ME)
2. [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - Java and Kotlin. The same platform is available in _many_ languages, for a yearly fee. 
3. [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/features/index.html) - Java, C/C++, Groovy, PHP, HTML5 Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS)
4. [Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) - Code in C#, Visual Basic, F#, C++, HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and more. 
5. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) - Java, Kotlin, C++, Groovy

#### More Information:
Many developer will also use a text editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom Editor](https://www.atom.io), or [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and use 3rd party extensions to add the features which they would get from a traditional **IDE**. **IDEs** generally use more of a computers resources than a text editor.
