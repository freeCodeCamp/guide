## Test Driven Development

Test Driven Development (TDD) is one of Agile Software Development approaches. It is based on the concept that
> you must write a test case for your code even before you write the code

It's basically composed of 4 steps

 - Write a test case
 - Execute
 - If fails, adjust your code
 - If pass, development continues

Each new feature of your system should follow the steps above.

Test Driven Development also promotes simplicity, as the code that comes after the new unit test should be "just enough code" to pass that test. TDD forces the focus of the code being written to work specifically for the feature or aspect of the program and nothing more.

TDD needs to be adopted by the entire development team and the tests be properly maintained, otherwise TDD will only work partially or not at all.
