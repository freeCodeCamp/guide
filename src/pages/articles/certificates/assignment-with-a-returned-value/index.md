title: Assignment with a Returned Value
---
If you'll recall from our discussion of Storing Values with the Equal Operator, everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned. This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.

Assume we have pre-defined a function `sum` which adds two numbers together, then:

    var ourSum = sum(5, 12);

will call `sum` function, which returns a value of `17` and assigns it to `ourSum` variable.
