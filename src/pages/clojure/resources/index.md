[Clojure](https://clojure.org/) is a dialect of Lisp with a focus on functional programming. It was released in 2007 by Rich Hickey, and has since gained a lot of popularity among web developers.

To learn about some of the language's core functions, you can consult the [documentation](https://clojuredocs.org/).
