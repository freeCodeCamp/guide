title: Advantages of Linux
---
## Constant and efficient improvements.

Linux updates happen through the global collaboration of developers. Bugs are documented and resolved much quicker with this type of support. Also, since the developers are also the end-users they have a motivation to make sure it meets user's needs and that it is designed to run well.

## Less risk.

Software is only as good as the support is given. Imagine a piece of software was created by ABC company and they go bankrupt or get bought by another company that decides to cut support. The software would never see improvements or fixes and therefore its usefulness would inevitably erode and die. Linux is owned and operated by no single entity or company, so this situation cannot happen. More than that anyone is free to pick it up and contribute as well. The risk of losing support for Linux is very unlikely due to its overwhelming popularity and use.

## Lightweight.

Linux's requirements for running on a system are much lower than that of Windows or Mac. With the right Linux distribution a user can have a modest setup and Linux will give the system value. Disk space and memory footprint can also be lower too. Some distributions are suitable for CPUs dating back to the Pentium family, others have a requirement of as little as 128MB of RAM and around the same amount for disk space!

## Heavily documented for beginners and advanced users alike.

Linux has an active community of those willing to share their knowledge and help (much like FreeCodeCamp!). There are command line utilities built into Linux that provide documentation on commands, libraries, standards, etc. (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Man pages</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Info_(Unix' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Info pages</a>), and there is documentation available on the Internet in a variety of formats (<a href='http://www.tldp.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>The Linux Documentation Project</a>, <a href='http://www.linuxquestions.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>LinuxQuestions</a>, <a href='http://serverfault.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>ServerFault</a>. There are self-paced certifications that can be taken that are recognized in the IT industry (<a href='https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/linux' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>CompTIA's Linux+</a> and <a href='https://www.lpi.org' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>LPI's LPIC tests</a>). Although not required, learning <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>C</a>) gives the ability for a user to review the Linux code to see what they are running.

## Business support.

The world depends on Linux supporting critical systems so the demand is not going away. This is important not only to those that help contribute to Linux, but also to those who support it (Jobs!). Linux support becomes more critical in IT, but also having that knowledge as a developer will make them more rounded and useful (i.e. <a href='https://medium.com/chris-messina/the-full-stack-employee-ed0db089f0a1#.ubttrv255' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Full stack developers</a>).

## Interoperability with other Operating Systems.

Linux has driver support for NTFS and HFS+ filesystems (used by Windows and Macs) and also <a href='https://www.samba.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Samba</a> for file/print service support on Windows machines.

## Better hardware support.

For other OSs, usually a user would have to go to the manufacturer's website to get driver support for different types of hardware. The Linux kernel supports a majority of hardware automatically via plug-and-play (largely in part because of the open source community).

## Software Availability/Compatibility.

Linux has a rich set of applications that are available. It has <a href='https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/libreoffice/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>office applications</a>, web browsers (<a href='https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Google Chrome</a> and <a href='https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Mozilla Firefox</a>), <a href='http://www.videolan.org/vlc/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>media players</a>, <a href='https://www.gimp.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>image</a>/<a href='http://www.openshot.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>video processing</a>, etc. For video gaming, <a href='http://store.steampowered.com/about/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Steam</a> runs on Linux which has many supported games. Windows applications can also run within Linux (see <a href='https://www.winehq.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Wine</a> for details).

## Built for development.

As Linux was originally made for developers by developers, they have spent much time and effort perfecting the tools that they would come to use. It has a powerful <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>shells</a> that can be used for a variety of both programming and administrative tasks (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Bash</a>) is the most popular and default choice for Linux). While Linux has a "notepad" equivalent in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedit' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>gedit</a>, it also provides more powerful and customizable text-based editors such as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Vim</a>) and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Emacs</a> (It is recommended Linux users know at least one of these editors). There are also IDEs available for web-development such as <a href='https://atom.io/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Atom</a>, <a href='http://www.aptana.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Aptana</a>/<a href='https://eclipse.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Eclipse</a>, <a href='https://www.sublimetext.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Sublime</a>, <a href='http://komodoide.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>KomodoIDE</a>, to name a few. Linux also can utilize software such as <a href='https://httpd.apache.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Apache</a> to setup a local web server for testing, <a href='https://git-scm.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Git</a> for version control, and other tools/languages such as <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Node.js</a>/<a href='https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Ruby</a>/<a href='http://sass-lang.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>SaSS</a>/<a href='https://www.heroku.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Heroku</a> all have support on Linux and have command line tools that can be used in lieu of a GUI.

## It's Free.

##Cost – The most obvious advantage of using Linux is the fact that it is free to obtain, whileMicrosoft products are available for a hefty and sometimes recurring fee. Microsoft licenses typically are only allowed to be installed on a single computer, whereas a Linux distribution can be installed on any number of computers, without paying a single dime.

##Security – In line with the costs, the security aspect of Linux is much stronger than that of Windows. Why should you have to spend extra money for virus protection software? The Linuxoperating system has been around since the early nineties and has managed to stay secure in the realm of widespread viruses, spyware and adware for all these years. Sure, the argument of the Linux desktop not being as widely used is a factor as to why there are no viruses. My rebuttle is that the Linux operating system is open source and if there were a widespread Linux virusreleased today, there would be hundreds of patches released tomorrow, either by ordinary people that use the operating system or by the distribution maintainers. We wouldn’t need to wait for a patch from a single company like we do with Windows.

##Choice (Freedom) – The power of choice is a great Linux advantage. With Linux, you have the power to control just about every aspect of the operating system. Two major features you have control of are your desktops look and feel by way of numerous Window Managers, and the kernel. In Windows, your either stuck using the boring default desktop theme, or risking corruption or failure by installing a third-party shell.

##Software – There are so many software choices when it comes to doing any specific task. You could search for a text editor on Freshmeat and yield hundreds, if not thousands of results. My article on 5 Linux text editors you should know about explains how there are so many options just for editing text on the command-line due to the open source nature of Linux. Regular users and programmers contribute applications all the time. Sometimes its a simple modification or feature enhancement of a already existing piece of software, sometimes its a brand new application. In addition, software on Linux tends to be packed with more features and greater usability than software on Windows. Best of all, the vast majority of Linux software is free and open source. Not only are you getting the software for no charge, but you have the option to modify the source codeand add more features if you understand the programming language. What more could you ask for?

##Hardware – Linux is perfect for those old computers with barely any processing power or memory you have sitting in your garage or basement collecting dust. Install Linux and use it as a firewall, a file server, or a backup server. There are endless possibilities. Old 386 or 486 computers with barely any RAM run Linux without any issue. Good luck running Windows on these machines and actually finding a use for them.

Hard to beat that!
