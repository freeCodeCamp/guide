title: Python Sequence Types
---
These represent finite ordered sets indexed by non-negative numbers. The built-in function `len()` returns the number of items of a sequence. When the length of a sequence is `n`, the index set contains the numbers `0, 1, ..., n-1`. Item `i` of sequence a is selected by `a[i]`.

*   Built-in sequence types are:
    *   `list`

    *   `tuple`
    *   `range`
*   Built-in sequence types are iterable types (implement required `__iter__()` method).
