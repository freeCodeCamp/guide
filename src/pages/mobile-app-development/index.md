This section contains articles related to Mobile Hybrid Applications Development using frameworks such as Apache Cordova, Ionic Framework, and React Native.

Apache Cordova is the wrapper that wraps your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a buildable mobile package, acting as the magic that glues everything together and turns it into a mobile app

Ionic Framework is a CSS framework that allows you to style your screens to look mobile friendly, essentially acting as bootstrap but for mobile apps while developing using web technologies.

React Native is a front end development framework that contains a lot of the building block elements for Android/iOS development and is a different kind of magic from Apache Cordova
