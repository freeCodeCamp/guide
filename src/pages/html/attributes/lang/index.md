## Lang

In HTML, Lang tag is used to declare the language of the whole or a part of a web page.

### Examples

```html
<html lang="en">
</html>
```

The lang attribute can also be used to specify the language of a specific element:

```html
<p lang="hi">
  फ्री कोड कैंप
</p>
```

In the above example, "hi" denotes the Hindi language. Similarly, you can use "en" for English, "es" for Spanish, "fr" for French and so on.

Refer to [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for the appropriate two-digit Language code.
