## Velocity

On a scrum team, you determine the velocity at the end of each Iteration. It is simply the sum of Story Points completed within the timebox.<br>

Having a predictable, consistent velocity allows your team to plan your iterations with some confidence, to work sustainably, and to forecast,  with empirical data, the amount of scope to include in each release.
