## Equation of a Line

### For a Given Slope and y-intercept (Standard Form):
Let `m` be the slope of the line and `b` be the y-intercept. (Note that the y-intercept is the point at which the given line crosses the y-axis). Then the equation of a line is:

`y = mx+b`

### For a Given Slope and One Point through which the Line Passes (Point-Slope Form):
Let `m` be the slope of the line and `(x1, y1)` be the co-ordinate of the point through which the given line passes. Then the equation of a line is:

`(y - y1) = m(x - x1)`

### For Two Points through which the Line Passes:
Let `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` be the co-ordinates of two points through which the given line passes. Then the equation of a line is:

`(y - y1)(x2 - x1) = (y2 - y1)(x - x1) `
