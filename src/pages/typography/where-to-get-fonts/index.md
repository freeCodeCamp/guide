Services offerring web fonts, such as Google Fonts or Fontspring provide an easy way to use different fonts on your web-page without the need to worry about whether or not your visitors have the font available on their system. Unlike desktop fonts, which come in .otf or .ttf formats, web fonts come in the form of a link you add to your CSS. Below are a few resources which offer web-fonts.

### Google Fonts

To use Google Fonts on your site, follow this [page](https://www.fonts.google.com) and browse the site to find the font that works best for your project. Once you've chosen, click the plus sign next to the font. A bar will appear at the bottom of the screen. Click on it. You will then be given several lines of code. Copy and paste the line of HTML into the head of your HTML file above the existing <link> element. Then take the CSS and use it where necessary in your stylesheet. 

You're done! You have successfully added new fonts for your site.

### Fonstpsring

[Fontspring](https://www.fontspring.com/) provides somewhat different kind of service than Google. Unlike Google Fonts that only provides you with a link, Fontspring offers each of their fonts in both desktop and web font version. The type of embedding available for Fontspring fonts is not simply with the help of one-line links, as on Google fonts, but rather with CSS `@font-face` rule. The service offerred by Fontspring is very user friendly, therefore, each web font comes with pre-made css code snippet you simply need to paste to your main CSS file.
