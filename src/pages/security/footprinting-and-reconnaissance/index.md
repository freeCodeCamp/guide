Footprinting is an information gathering process, also known as passive reconnaissance. In this process, different tools and techniques are used to collect every possible information against the target and its environment. This is a pre-attack stage and stealth operations are executed and target can never trace back.

A hacker uses several freely available resources to gather maximum information passively. In this process no direct contact is made with the target. Footprinting plays a crucial role in determining the success in later steps/hacking attempts.
