## The OSI Layers

### Introduction
Have you ever wondered how data is sent through the network from one machine to another? If yes, then the Open System Interconnected model is what you are looking for. 
The OSI model is used to help standardise and characterise how data should flow from sender to receiver without the taking into consideration the underlying internal structure of the endpoint (sender, receiver).
The organisation that came up with this model is the *International Standardisation Organisation* and hence this model is formally referred to as **ISO - OSI**.
