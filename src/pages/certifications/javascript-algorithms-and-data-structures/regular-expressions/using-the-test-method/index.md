## Using the Test Method

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
In this challenge, you are checking to see if a string contains a certain "regular expression", or **regex** (**reg**ular **ex**pressions). You will use the `test()` method to do that.

## Hint 1:

Call the test method on `myRegex`. What do you think the argument will be?

## Spoiler Alert - Solution Ahead!

## Solution

```javascript
let myString = "Hello, World!";
let myRegex = /Hello/;
let result = myRegex.test(myString); // Change this line
```
