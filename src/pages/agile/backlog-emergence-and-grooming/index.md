## Backlog Emergence and Grooming

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
The backlog is the set of tasks a team wants to complete in order to fulfill the user stories. The backlog is a list of things an agile team wants to work on in order of priority such as features, bugs, and more in order to advance the overall project. In each Agile sprint, a team will select a number of tasks to complete, that they believe they will be able to complete within the sprint, and then during the sprint the team completes those tasks.

Backlog grooming is necessary however, becasue plans change and modification of the backlog is necessary to keep up with those changes. If a team deems a feature no longer necessary, it must be removed from the backlog. Conversely, if a bug is introduced, or a new feature is required, the team must add that to the backlog. Finally, the order of the backlog may change as priorities of the client or the team changes.
