## Hexcode

Hex code is also know as Hexadecimal code that writes numbers in more digits. Decimal is base 10 meaning that 0-9 is used
to form a number. In hexadecimal the base is 16 meaning that we use 0-9 plus A,B,C,D,E,F . This allows us to write large numbers in fewer digits. Hexadecimal numerals are widely used by computer system designers and programmers. A great example front-end developers would be familiar with Hex code for colors for example black (#000000) or white (#ffffff).
