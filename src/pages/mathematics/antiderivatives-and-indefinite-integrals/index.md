## Antiderivatives and Indefinite Integrals

Calculating an antiderivative and integrating an indefinite integral are synonymous. An "indefinite" integral is one which is considered across all numerical values, from -∞  to +∞ (i.e. there are no numbers in the upper or lower bound of the integration symbol).

Integration calculates the area under a particular curve, that which is defined in the integrand. Indefinite interals consider the areas of infinitely many, infinitely small rectangles to calculate the area under a particlar curve.

Real-life applications of Antiderivatives and Indefinite Integrals are commonly found in physics, where one can integrate a given velocity to calculate how far a particular object has moved (displacement).
