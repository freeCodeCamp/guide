## Wireshark

Wireshark is a very popular, open source network analyzer application that is available for Linux, macOS and Windows. It allows the user to "sniff" packets being sent to and from different nodes on a network. According to their website, "it lets you see whatâ€™s happening on your network at a microscopic level". It can be used for network troubleshooting, analysis, checking software and communication protocol development as well as education.

In Wireshark, the user begins by selecting to capture packets. The packets are color coded and the user can let the application capture them for as long as they desire. After the packets are captured, the user would select the stop button on the user interface and begin the analysis, filtering and inspection. An example of why someone interested in software development would use Wireshark would be to confirm that their application is properly encrypting data before sending it over a network where it is open for others to sniff.

Wireshark is a powerful application that has many features. Linked below is the website to download Wireshark, the Wikipedia entry for Wireshark that goes into more detail on the history of it, as well as a simple tutorial from How-to Geek to get you started sniffing those packets.
