## Voice

### Alexa

The Alexa platform was created by Amazon, and formally released for development by external parties in 2015. It provides the ability for users to interact with Alexa enabled devices using just their voice, and no interaction with a touch screen. The platform contains both hardware and software components. Amazon manufactures and sells the hardware devices which come with a variety of features and price points.

The Amazon Echo Dot is a hockey puck sized device.

The Amazon Echo Tap is a battery powered device, and larger than the Dot.

The Amazon Echo is a full sized upright speaker that is roughly twice the size of the Tap.

The Amazon Echo Show is not only a voice activated speaker, but it also has a seven inch display, and shorter than the full sized unit.

Each of the devices have far field microphones, capable of hearing 25-30 feet away from the user.

The software components within the platform include both Natural Language Understanding (NLU) as well as Automated Speech Recognition (ASR).  These software components can be leveraged by custom written "skills" by independent software developers that are then certified to a set of standards by Amazon. There are already more than 20k of these custom skills available through their app store.


### The Voice Of Alexa: From Real Life To Artificial

What about the voice of virtual assistants such as Amazon Alexa? Today, newer voice assistants derive their own voice through machine learning. This process allows the virtual assistant to learn the nuances in language and how to respond to certain requests. Machine learning is commonly used by search engines to provide targeted advertisements to users. For the virtual assistant, the process is essentially like boot camp. So there is no human voice behind Alexa, but rather a conglomeration of voices that Alexa may have learned from the Internet or through machine learning. Although Alexa is always learning, it’s quite impressive that her voice has remained stable since her launch.

### Why Build Alexa Devices?

Alexa is Amazon’s cloud-based intelligent voice service and the brain behind tens of millions of devices. Customers talk to Alexa through the Echo family of devices and over a hundred third-party products with Alexa built-in made by the world’s leading consumer electronics brands. There are also tens of thousands of third-party Alexa-connected devices. With Alexa, device makers can build voice-forward products that offer a natural user interface and reach customers across the globe by joining the network of Alexa devices, skills, and services. You have the flexibility to build devices with Alexa built-in that customers can talk to directly, and connect your devices to the Alexa solutions below.

### Why Connect Your Devices to Alexa?

Alexa is Amazon’s voice service and the brain behind tens of millions of devices like the Amazon Echo family of devices, FireTV, Fire Tablet, and third-party devices with Alexa native smart home voice user interface. Customers can use Alexa to control smart devices such as cameras, door locks, entertainment systems, lighting, and thermostats. By connecting your device to Alexa, you can increase customer awareness and engagement with your smart devices. You can use our native smart home voice user interface, features such as Alexa Routines and Groups, and more. And, you can certify your connected devices through the Works with Alexa program to ensure an intuitive, hassle-free experience, and to make it easy for customers to discover them online and offline.

The Decice connectivity options are :
1.In the Cloud
You can connect your device cloud to Alexa using the Smart Home and Custom Skill APIs. Alexa alerts your skill when a customer wants to control your device, and your skill and cloud service then send instructions to your device over the internet.

2.Locally
You can connect your devices to the new Echo Show and Echo Plus using Zigbee, or using other smart home hubs. Alexa communicates with the hub over the internet, and the hub communicates with your device.

3.On Your Device
You can integrate a hardware module designed by Amazon on your device using the Alexa Connect Kit (preview), or ACK. Alexa communicates with the ACK module over the Internet, and the module communicates with your device using a serial interface.

4.Echo-Paired
You can pair your devices to an Echo device using Bluetooth and the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit (Beta) to build accessories that respond to what the Echo is doing. The Echo sends event information to your device, including timers, alarms, and text-to-speech (TTS) wordmarks.
