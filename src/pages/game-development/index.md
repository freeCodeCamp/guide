## Game Development

Game Development involves the use of software to create and design video games that can be played on a PC, smartphone/tablet, or console. Games are usually designed and restricted based on the console it is designed for. Video games can be developed with several kinds of game-developing software.

Some of the more well-known game development software programs are: Unity, Unreal Engine, and GameMaker Studio. However, a lot of mainstream games are developed with a custom-made engine.

Popular languages used in game programming include: C++, C#, JavaScript, Python, and Java.
