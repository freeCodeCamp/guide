## What are Greedy Algorithms?
Greedy Algorithms are techniques that are designed to make the most optimal solution for a given problem locally. Meaning, decisions made based on the most optimal solution given two choices at each stage in hopes of finding a most optimal solution for the entire scope of the problem. However, they Greedy Algorithms don't generally generate globally optimized solutions to problems.
