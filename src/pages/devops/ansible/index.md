## Ansible
Ansible is free IT automation software developed by Michael DeHaan and owned by Red Hat. Ansible is part of Red Hat's four-piece systems management tool set for enterprise IT, which also includes Satellite, CloudForms and the Red Hat Insights service. There is a free open source version of the software and a paid version, Ansible Tower.
Ansible aims to be:

1.Clear - Ansible uses a simple syntax (YAML) and is easy for anyone (developers, sysadmins, managers) to understand. APIs are simple and     sensible.
2.Fast - Fast to learn, fast to set up—especially considering you don’t need to install extra agents or daemons on all your servers!
3.Complete - Ansible does three things in one, and does them very well. Ansible’s ‘batteries included’ approach means you have everything     you need in one complete package.
4.Efficient - No extra software on your servers means more resources for your applications. Also, since Ansible modules work via JSON,       Ansible is extensible with modules written in a programming language you already know.
5.Secure - Ansible uses SSH, and requires no extra open ports or potentially-vulnerable daemons on your servers.

## DevOps
DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.


## Relation between Ansible and DevOps
 DevOps is meant to shorten the distance between the developers writing the code, and the operators running the application.One of the first steps towards a DevOps environment is choosing tools that can be consumed by both developers and operations engineers. Ansible 
is one of those tools:you don’t have to be a software developer to use it, and the playbooks that you write can easily be self-documenting.

There have been a lot of attempts at “write once, run anywhere” models of application development and deployment, but Ansible is one of the closest to providing a common language that’s useful across teams and across clouds and different datacenters.
