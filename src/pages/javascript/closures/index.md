# Closures

A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.

```js
function by(propName) {
    return function(a, b) {
        return a[propName] - b[propName];
    }
}

const person1 = {name: 'joe', height: 72};
const person2 = {name: 'rob', height: 70};
const person3 = {name: 'nicholas', height: 66};

const arr_ = [person1, person2, person3];

const arr_sorted = arr_.sort(by('height')); // [ { name: 'nicholas', height: 66 }, { name: 'rob', height: 70 },{ name: 'joe', height: 72 } ]

```

The closure 'remembers' the environment in which it was created. This environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created.

```js
function outside(num) {
  var rememberedVar = num; // In this example, rememberedVar is the lexical environment that the closure 'remembers'
  return function inside() { // This is the function which the closure 'remembers'
    console.log(rememberedVar)
  }
}

var remember1 = outside(7); // remember1 is now a closure which contains rememberedVar = 7 in its lexical environment, and //the function 'inside'
var remember2 = outside(9); // remember2 is now a closure which contains rememberedVar = 9 in its lexical environment, and //the function 'inside'

remember1(); // This now executes the function 'inside' which console.logs(rememberedVar) => 7
remember2(); // This now executes the function 'inside' which console.logs(rememberedVar) => 9 
```
Closures are useful because they let you 'remember' data and then let you operate on that data through returned functions. This allows javascript to emulate private methods that are found in other programming languages. Private methods are useful for restricting access to code as well as managing your global namespace.

### Private variables and methods

Closures can also be used to encapsulate private data/methods. Take a look at this example:

```javascript
const bankAccount = (initialBalance) => {
  const balance = initialBalance;

  return {
    getBalance: function() {
      return balance;
    },
    deposit: function(amount) {
      balance += amount;
      return balance;
    },
  };
};

const account = bankAccount(100);

account.getBalance(); // 100
account.deposit(10); // 110
```

In this example, we won't be able to access `balance` from anywhere outside of the `bankAccount` function, which means we've just created a private variable. Where's the closure? Well, think about what `bankAccount()` is returning. It actually returns an Object with  a bunch of functions inside it, and yet when we call `account.getBalance()`, the function is able to "remember" its initial reference to `balance`. That is the power of the closure, where a function "remembers" its lexical scope (compile time scope), even when the function is executed outside that lexical scope.
