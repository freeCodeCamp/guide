Ansible is an open-source, automation devops tool, based on the ideology of infrastructure-as-code. It is aimed at configuration management and app deployment. It is an automation tool with scripts written in YAML. YAML is similar to JSON and is mostly the choice for most configuration management softwares.

<p>
Ansible is backed by an agentless architecture wherein, daemons/services are not required to be installed and running on the client to communicate with the server.

Ansible was acquired by Redhat and competes with Amazon AWS CloudFormation, HashiCorp Terraform, Chef, Puppet, SaltStack.

Ansible can deploy applications to many infrastructures, including bare-metal, cloud, containers, virtual machines etc. Ansible servers are Linux based, while clients can be Linux-based or Windows. For Linux, it communicates to nodes using OpenSSH and for Windows, it uses Windows Powershell Remoting (WinRM).
