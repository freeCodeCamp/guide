## Tautologies

Tautology is a formula that is always true in every possible interpretation. A very basic example would be “A⇒A” – A implies A. You don’t need to know what A means. You don’t need to know if A itself is a true or false statement. The statement that A implies A: that is, if A is true, then A must be true – must be true.
