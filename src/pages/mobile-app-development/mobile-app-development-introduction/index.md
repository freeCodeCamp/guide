### Introduction to App Development
One of the more popular forms of coding in recent times is the creation of applications, or apps, that run on mobile devices like phones and tablets. You probably use a range of different apps in your everyday life. Wouldn’t it be cool to create one of your own?
There are many perks of being a developer in the booming app industry. Quite a few people make a good living developing and selling apps, and you have the opportunity to be one of them. You could even become the next Nick D’Aloisio, who famously sold his iPhone app, Summly, to Yahoo! for $30m.
Plus, it’s the best way to get your work into people’s pockets!

### App Development Overview
Mobile apps are developed for a certain platform, and the two most popular platforms today are iOS and Android.
The iOS platform powers apps built for iPhone and iPad. To develop an app for iPhone or iPad, you need to use the Objective-C coding language and the Cocoa framework. You also need to use an IDE (integrated development environment) called Xcode. Note that Xcode only runs on the Mac, so you will need a Mac to make an iOS app.Android apps are developed with the Java coding language and the Android Software Development Kit, which runs on Mac, PC or Linux. You also need to use an IDE such as Eclipse.There are other mobile platforms such as Windows Phone, but iOS and Android are definitely the most popular. Most training focuses on these platforms.

It provides commercial software development tools that allow a user to develop applications for Android, iOS and Windows using C# language and the .NET framework. Xamarin is built on the .NET Framework. It allows one to create apps that easily run across multiple platforms. In this tutorial, we will explain how you can use Xamarin to deliver native iOS, Android, and Windows Apps.

#### PhoneGap
