# Official documentation
1. [Language specification](https://golang.org/ref/spec)
2. [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)

## Godoc.org (https://godoc.org/)

The documentation within golang.org includes the standard library and the src.

The good thing about __godoc.org__ is that includes the standard library AND third-party packages.
