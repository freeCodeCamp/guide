## Breadth First Search (BFS)

Breadth First Search is one of the most simple graph algorithms. It traverses the graph by first checking the current node and then expanding it by adding its successors to the next level. The process is repeated for all nodes in the current level before moving to the next level. If the solution is found the search stops.

### Evaluation

Space Complexity: O(n)

Worse Case Time Complexity: O(n)

Breadth First Search is complete on a finite set of nodes and optimal if the cost of moving from one node to another is constant.
