## Header Tag
The purpose of the `<header>` tag is to provide a section for introductory content or navigation. The context of the header can be for:
* The main header that appears at the top of the page
* For an indvidual `<article>` or `<section>` within the page

The `<header>` typically contains the section's heading(s), or content placed inside `<h1>` - `<h6>` tags, but they can also contain elements like a logo, a search form, or authorship information. 

### Example
```html
<article>
  <header>
    <h1>This Best Article Ever</h1>
    <h3>By: The Best Author Ever</h3>
    <p>Created: Not too long ago...</p>
  </header>
  <p>This is the the content to the best article ever</p>
</article>
```
