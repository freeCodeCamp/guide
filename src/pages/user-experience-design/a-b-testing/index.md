## What is A B Testing?

A/B testing (sometimes called split testing) is comparing two versions of a web page or element to see which one performs better. You compare two web pages or elements by showing the two variants (let's call them A and B) to similar visitors at the same time. The one that gives a better conversion rate, wins!

Every website wants visitors converting from just visitors to something else(Convertions, sign ups, or just take action for something). The rate at which a website is able to do this is its "conversion rate". Measuring the performance of a variation (A or B) means measuring the rate at which it converts visitors to goal achievers.
