In Python, a list comprehension is a brief but comprehensive way to create a list of items from an iterator. 

The syntax is a bracket, with an expression followed by a 'for statement' over an iterator.

>>> num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> list_comp1 = [x**2 for x in num_list]
>>> list_comp1
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

Besides being more compact than a regular for loop, where you would push the value of an expression into a list, it is also
faster than a normal for loop.
