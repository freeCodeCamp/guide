The Python syntax for declaring function is as follows:
```python
>>> def say_hello():
...     print('Hello')
```
Python functions are declared by the <i>def</i> keyword, followed by the function name and any arguments that may be required. This initial declaration line ends with a colon (:). 

The code block that follows the function declaration must be indented (single) in order to be valid Python. This is because Python follows the off-side rule which means that code blocks are determined by their level of indentation.
