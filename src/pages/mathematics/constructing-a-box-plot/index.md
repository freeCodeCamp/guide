## Constructing a Box Plot
Box plots, also called box-and-whisker plots, are representations of data for a single variable. When you have a collection of numerical data, you can find the median, minimum, maximum, upper quartile, and lower quartile, and make a box plot. You make a box above a number line with one end at the points of the upper and lower quartiles, and a line inside at the median. You then make lines at the minimum and maximum and draw lines to the nearest edge of the box.
