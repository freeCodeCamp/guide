## Daily Stand-up and Daily Scrum

The Daily Stand-Up (DSU) or Daily Scrum meeting is one of the key ceremonies of the scrum methodology.

As the name suggests, you hold the meeting daily, at the same time and, for a co-located team, in the same location. The meeting should be brief, finished in less than 15 minutes.

The standard agenda for each person is:
* What have you done since the last DSU
* What are you doing after this DSU
* What are the major obstacles that are stopping your progress, and where do you need help
