Non-functional requirements are often called “quality attributes”, “constraints” or “non-behavioral requirements”. </p>\n<p>Informally, these are sometimes called the “ilities”, from attributes like stability and portability. NFRs can be divided into two main categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Execution qualities</strong>, such as safety, security and usability, which are observable during operation (at run time).</li>\n<li><strong>Evolution qualities</strong>, such as testability, maintainability, extensibility and scalability, which are embodied in the static structure of the system</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Usually you can refine a non-functional requirement into a set of functional requirements as a way of detailing and allowing (partial) testing and validation.</p>\n<h3>Examples:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The printer should print 5 seconds after the button is pressed</li>\n<li>The code should be written in Java</li>\n<li>The UI should be easily navigable</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<!-- Please add any articles you think might be helpful to read before writing the article -->\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement">Wikipedia article</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://reqtest.com/requirements-blog/functional-vs-non-functional-requirements/">ReQtest</a> Explains the difference between functional and nonfunctional requirements</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/nonfunctional-requirements/">Scaled Agile</a> Works through the process from finding to testing nonfunctional requirements</li>\n</ul>',fields:{slug:"/agile/nonfunctional-requirements/"},frontmatter:{title:"Nonfunctional Requirements"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/agile/nonfunctional-requirements/"}}}});
