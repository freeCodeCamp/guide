### Significant figures of a number are all of the digits that carry meaning to the final representation of a measurement. They represent how precise the measurement is.
#### The rules to find which digits of a number are significant figures:
- All non-zero digits are significant
- All zeros between non-sero digits are significant: 202, 2002, 20002
- Leading zeros aren't significant
- In a decimal number, all trailing zeros represent precision, and thusly are significant
- In a non-decimal number, if there is a "." at the end, all figures to the left are significant (except leading zeros)
#### Examples:
##### 0.05400 has [4] sig figs: 5, 4, 0 and 0
##### 0.0054090 has [5] sig figs: 5, 4, 0, 9, and 0
##### 100 has [1] sig fig: 1
##### 100. has [3] sig figs: 1, 0, and 0
