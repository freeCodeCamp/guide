<h1>if statement</h1>
An if statement detects which block of code to run based on a boolean expression.

<h2>Example</h2>
The below code sample will write "This is true." since a is less than b. 

```
int a = 2;
int b = 3;
if(a < b)
{
  Console.Writeline("This is true.");
}
else
{
  Console.Writeline("This is false.");
}
```

<h3>Output</h3>

```
This is true.
```
