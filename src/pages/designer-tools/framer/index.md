## Framer

<p>Framer is a complete workflow for creating interactive designs whether solo or in a team. With pre-set animations, pre-made native interactions, and multiple screen app flows, you can quickly build and prototype your designs. The design aspect has an auto-layout and smart grouping algorithms, allowing the design space to interact and respond to the various elements added onto it and keeping the hierarchy in tact. Framer also supports Handoff, a simple way to deliver accurate conversions to developers once the design stage is complete. <p>
