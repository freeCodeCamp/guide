## Trojans

What is a trojan horse? A trojan horse is a program that is either entirely malware or a program that acts as an actual program but has malware built in. A trojan horse use is to open a backdoor into a system so malware can be uploaded or automatically downloaded and ran. Trojan horses are extremely easy to detect with the right software by themself but more complex ones will act as a legitimate program that will ask you to download something and that something is malware. Trojans are also very present in videogame torrents because if you're already giving something illegally to someone, then why not add some malware to spice things up a bit? Trojans are slowly fading out of use due to people actually being able to write their own exploits and not have to try to social engineer a person to download anything and instead just punch right through their firewall.
