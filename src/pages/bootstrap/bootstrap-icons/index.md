## Bootstrap Icons
 ### Getting Started
Make sure you have Bootstrap installed. An easy way to do this is to link it to the Bootstrap CDN. For more info: https://guide.freecodecamp.org/bootstrap/bootstrap-get-started
 ### Usage
  Icons are a good way to give visual refrence to links or messages eg. (error symbol, menu icon, visual links, etc.)
  To use create a span element w/ the class set to the icon you want eg. 
  ```html
<span class="glyphicon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
```
This will display
