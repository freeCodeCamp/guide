## C#

C Sharp, more commonly referred to as "C#", is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. C# was developed by Anders Hejlsberg and his development team at Microsoft and is currently on version 7.0.

C# has its roots in the family of C languages. It inherits most of its feature from C, C++, and Java. For this reason, programmers familiar with C/C++/Java may be able to get up to speed with C# in a shorter timespan.

C# is an object-oriented language while also providing support for component-oriented programming.

#### Features of C# include:
1) Automatic Garbage Collection
2) Exceptional Handling
3) Type-safety
4) Versioning
5) Delegates
6) Properties
7) LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) and Lambda Expressions
8) Generics
9) Indexers

You can use C# to create Windows client applications, XML Web services, distributed components, client-server applications, database applications, and much more.
