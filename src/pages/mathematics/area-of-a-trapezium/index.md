## Area of a Trapezium

Area of a Trapezium is defined by the 2D space enclosed by the Trapezium. A trapezium is a Quadrilateral by 2 oposite parallel sides of equal or unequal length and 2 opposite non parallel sides of equal or unequal length.

Let the parallel sides be represented by 'a' and 'b' and the perpendicular distance between these parallel sides be 'h'
then
The Area of the Trapezium = 1/2 * (a+b) * h
 
 which means Area of Trapezium = 1/2 * (sum of parallel sides) * (perpendicular distance between parallel sides).
 
 ## Note:
 
 Area of trapezium can also be found out by dividing the trapezium into a series of triangle and rectangle and finally adding their areas separately.
