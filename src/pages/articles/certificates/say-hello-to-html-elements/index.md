title: Say Hello to HTML Elements
---
HTML elements are written with a starting tag, an ending tag, and the content in between:

*   `<tagname>content</tagname>`

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

*   `<p>My first HTML paragraph.</p>`

Opening tags look like this: `<h1>`, and closing tags look like this: `</h1>`

*   Note that the only difference between opening tags and closing tags, is that closing tags have a slash after their opening angle bracket. The slash in the closing tag is very important because it indicates that the tag is the end of the element.
