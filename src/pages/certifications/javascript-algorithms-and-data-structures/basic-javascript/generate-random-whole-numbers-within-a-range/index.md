## Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range

**Help for passing the final test:**
*`randomRange` should use both `myMax` and `myMin`, and return a random number in your range.*

You cannot pass the final test if you are only re-using the function `ourRandomRange` inside your `randomRange` formula. You need to write your own formula that uses the variables `myMax` and `myMin`. It will do the same job as using `ourRandomRange`, but ensures that you have understood the principles of the `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()` functions.
