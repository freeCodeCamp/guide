## CSS Color Propery 


You can use the `color` property to set the color of the text in an element.  


You can use several methods to declare a color such as: 
* By Name (Note: this only works with certain colors)

```css
h1{
    color: blue;
}
```

* Hexadecimal (specified as #rrggbb)

```css
h1{ 
    color:  #0000ff;
} 
```

* RGB (specified as rgb(r, g, b))

```css
h1{
    color: rgb(0, 0, 255);
}
```

* HSL (Hue, Lightness, Saturation)
    
```css
h1{
    color: hsl(240, 100%, 50%);
}
```
