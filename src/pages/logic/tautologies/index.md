## Tautologies

A tautology is a formula which is "always true" --- that is, it is true for every assignment of truth values to its simple components. You can think of a tautology as a rule of logic.

An example in terms of Boolean logic is `B || !B`. It is always true that B is true or B is not true.

The opposite of a tautology is a contradiction, a formula which is "always false". In other words, a contradiction is false for every assignment of truth values to its simple components.

An example of a contradiction with Boolean logic is `B && !B`. It is impossible for B to be both true and false at the same time.
