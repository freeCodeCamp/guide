## Reciprocal

The **reciprocal** of a number is 1 divided by that number.

#### Example 

The reciprocal of 3 is <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>

A **reciprocal** can also be defined as a number taken to the power of -1.

#### Example 

<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> is same as 8 to the power of -1.

You can also take a reciprocal of a fraction by flipping the fraction. 
For instance, reciprocal of <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> is <sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>.

### Note
1. Reciprocal of a reciprocal is the original number.

#### Example 

Reciprocal of 23 is <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>23</sub>. Now if we take the reciprocal of <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>23</sub> and filp the fraction, we get <sup>23</sup>⁄<sub>1</sub> which is the original number.

2. If you multiply a number by its reciprocal, you always get 1.

#### Example 

Reciprocal of 16 is <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub>. If you multiply <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub> with 16, you get 1.

3. Zero does not have a reciprocal
