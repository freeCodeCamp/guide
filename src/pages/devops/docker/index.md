## Docker

Docker is an open source project to build, ship and run containers for software applications. 
Docker implements high-level API to provide lightweight containers that run processes in isolation. This means a single server or virtual machine can run several concurrent containers.

Features of Docker:

  * Fast and consistent delivery of application by streamlining the development lifecycle
  * Docker's container-based platform allows for highly portable workload
  * Run more workloads on the same server or virtual machine.
  * Deliver applications safer across the entire lifecycle with integrated security capabilities.

#### What are containers?
Containers are a method that abstracts the operating system for running distributed applications. It is a lightweight piece of software that contains application code and dependencies.
This operating system virtualization allows quick, reliable and consistent deployment of applications.
