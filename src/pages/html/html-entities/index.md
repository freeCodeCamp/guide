## HTML Entities

HTML Entities are codes that allow you to enter special characters that are either reserved or cannot be found on your keyboard. These characters include the copyright symbol, the non-breaking space, and many others.

### Using an HTML Entity

There are two ways that you can use an HTML entity. By inserting the entity name, or  the entity number. For example, to use the "copyright", enter it as such:

```
<html>
   <body>
    <footer>
    <!-- character name followed by character number -->
      &copy; &#169;
    </footer>
   </body>
</html>
```
