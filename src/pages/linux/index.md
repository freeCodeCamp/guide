## Linux

Linux is an open source, unix based operating system created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.  Linux was first started as a clone of the MINIX operating system.  Open source contributors added onto the kernel and expanded its hardware compatability.  Linux's hardware supoort and free licensing made linux a popular choice for desktop and server computing in the mid 90s.  Today, linux is the most popular operating system in the world. It powers 90% of the world's servers, and is the basis of Google's popular Android operating system.

There are many versions of Linux, called distributions, designed to be run on personal computers.They vary widely, some of the more popular are listed below. Take your pic!

1. <a href= "https://www.ubuntu.com/" target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Ubuntu</a> : Perhaps the most common of all Linux distributions, this OS owes it's massive popularity to it's user friendliness, speed, stabilty and versatility. This is perfect for both newcomers and experienced users of Linux.
2. <a href = "https://elementary.io/" target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Elementary OS</a>: One of the few Linux distributions that keeps all the technical underpinnings of other distributions, all the while packing in a much cleaner and user friendly UI from the get go.
3. <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/" target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Arch Linux</a> : One of the few distributions that feature unrivaled performance while giving up many comfort features. We recommend this distribution to people who have been using Linuc for quite some time as this requires everything, except the core OS, to be built form scratch. It's a favorite among the power users.
4. <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/" target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Gentoo</a> : Another favorite among power users, this distribution too uses the approach employed by Arch Linux where the user will have to build everything, barring the core OS , from scratch.
