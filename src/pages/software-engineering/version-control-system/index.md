A Version Control System (VCS) records changes to files over time, so you can recall specific versions later. This allows you to track changes to files (and see who made them), revert the entire project to a previous state, restore files to previous versions, and identify where a specific change or bug was introduced. A VCS can be used to track changes to any files for any project; it is especially useful for teams working on software source code, allowing even geographically-distributed teams to collaborate on the same collection of files.

#### Types of Version Control Systems
There are a few different types of Version Control Systems: Centralized and Decentralized. In Centralized VCS (like [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/)) users share a single repository. In Decentralized VCS (like [Git](https://git-scm.com/)) each user has a local copy of the full repository.

#### Terminology
Repository - The set of files or directories that are under version control
Commit - To submit your changes (Add / Modify / Delete) as a single collection of actions

#### Common Version Control Systems
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/)
* [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)
