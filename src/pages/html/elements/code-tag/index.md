## Code Tag
Another cool tag you can use when coding at HTML scenario, is `<code>` which should be used to show computer code fragments to users. Very useful when you need to write a coding tutorial with basic `html`. 

The `<code>`tag isn't self closing, so you need to be sure to write `</code>` when finishing your code declaration.  

### Example
```html
<code> 
  var x = 20;  
</code>
```
### Code Attributes
The `code` tag has no specific new attributes, only the global ones.
