Mood Boards are a great way for people to assess their emotions and personality. It is a way for them to share their style, direction, brand, or project. Creating a mood board allows collaboration from not only the audience, but from the interface designers as well. By having a mood board on hand, designers are able to base a website off the colors and images chosen for the board. 

Ultimately, the main goal of a mood board is to inspire passion and create an emotional experience for the user. You can combine colors of different palettes, galleries, and unique fonts in order to demonstrate the feeling you want to share with those who lay eyes on the board.
