title: Ethical Design Manifesto
---
The Ethical Design Manifesto is created by the social enterprise ind.ie under Creative Commons. It's conceptualized as a pyramid, with three basic principles:
1. Respect human rights
2. Respect human effort
3. Respect human experience

This is a bottom-up process. If human rights are not respected, it doesn't matter how good the user experience is - it still doesn't fulfill the requirements for Ethical Design.
