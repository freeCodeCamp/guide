## What Is the Domain of a Function
<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->

The domain of a function is the complete set of possible values of the independent variable. In other words, the domain is the set of all possible x-values which will make the function "work", and will output real y-values.

For example, for <span class='texhtml'>y = sqrt(x + 2)</span>, the domain of this function is <span class='texhtml'>x >= -2</span>.
