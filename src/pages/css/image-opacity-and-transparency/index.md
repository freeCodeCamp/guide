## Image Opacity and Transparency

You can use the Opacity property to determine the transparency of your images.
Opacity is defined by any value between 0.0 to 1.0 with 0 being the lowest (transparent) and 1 being the highest (fully opaque).

### Example

```css
/* completely transparent*/

img{

  opacity:0;

}

/*half transparency*/

img{

  opacity:0.5;

}

/*fully opaque*/

img{

  opacity:1;

}
  ````
