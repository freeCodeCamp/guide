## Hard Drives

Hard drives are spinning magnetic disks that serve as long-term storage for computer data.

Hard drives come in various sizes, some up to even 8TB (8 trillion bytes). Typical computers come with between 256GB (256 million bytes) to 1TB. Laptops usually use Solid State Drives (SSDs) because they are faster, lighter, and contain no moving parts, making them less likely to fail due to impact. For the same amount of storage, SSDs are generally more expensive than hard drives. 

Hard drives use magnetic needles and rotating magnetized platters to store data. Because of these moving parts, hard drives are easily damaged by drops or shocks. The motor that rotates the platters also consumes a lot of power, but no other storage method is as affordable for large volumes of storage.

Computers store files on hard drives for later use. Because they have moving parts, it takes much longer to read a file from a hard drive than from RAM or memory on the CPU. 

You can think of a hard drive as a filing cabinet: a place to store things that we aren't using right now, but need later. You don't have enough room on your desk for all your papers, so you store things you aren't using right now in the filing cabinet. A computer does just this. It keeps files it is using right now in RAM, and files it might need later stay on the hard drive.
