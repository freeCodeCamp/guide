## Definition of Mode

The mode of a set of numbers indicates the value which occurs most frequently in the set.
Given a distribution of data, the mode can be described as the maximum of either the probability mass function if the data are discrete, or the probability distribution function if the data are continuous. A set of number in which there are numbers which occur most frequently may be described as bimodel, and any number greater than two is said to be multimodal. 

### Example:

Given a set of numbers (1 1 2 4 5 5 8 9 10 1 3 7), the mode = 1, as this is the number which most frequently occurs.
