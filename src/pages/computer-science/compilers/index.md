## Compilers

Compilers are a kind of translator. We write the source code in JavaScript, Python, and other languages. Then the compiler takes the code and converts it to code the computer understands.

This converted code is binary code, which is nothing but 1s and 0s. When you run your source code, a compiler translates all the code first, then produces the binary code. Then the computer takes the binary code and runs it.

If there are errors in your source code, the compiler detects them. This stops the compilation process. Even after the compiler converts the code, the converted code can still fail when it's running.
