## Sprint Review
Sprint reviews are generally practiced in Scrum, where the goal of each sprint is to deliver a shippable product increment. This means that at the end of each sprint, the team has produced a coded, tested and usable piece of software.

Participants in the sprint review typically include the product owner, the Scrum team, the ScrumMaster, management, customers and developers from other projects.

During the sprint review, the project is assessed against the sprint goal determined during the sprint planning meeting. Ideally, the team has completed each product backlog item brought into the sprint, but it's more important that they achieve the overall goal of the sprint.
