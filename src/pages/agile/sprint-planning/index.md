## Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning opens each Sprint. During Sprint Planning the Scrum Team decides what it will be able to deliver at the end of the Sprint.

As described in the <a href='http://www.scrumguides.org'>Scrum Guide</a>, Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a 
one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

The input to this meeting is the Product Backlog, the latest product Increment, projected capacity of the Development Teamduring the 
Sprint, and past performance of the Development Team. 

Only the Development Team members can decide how many Backlog Items are taken into the Sprint.
