 **MoSCoW** - **Must have**, **Should have**, **Could have**, **Won't have *(at this time)* **

In a typical project, all the requirements are important. However, not everything thing can be done in a given time. So these requirements are prioritized and then delivered based on most immediate to less immediate to business. MoSCow method is one of the prioritization technique used to assess these requirements.

- **Must have**
  - The requirements labeled *Must have* are critical requirements of the project. So these requirements are necessary for the project delivery. If one of the requirements is not completed then the project delivery is failed.
  
- **Should have**
  - The requirements labeled *Should have* are important but not critical to the project. The project can be delivered without implementing these requirements. It is good to have these requirements implemented if there is enough time in the project timeline.
  
- **Could have**
  - The requirements of *Could have* are similar to the *Should have*. However, these requirements are more related desired requirements, it is good to have these implemented in a project but is not important compared to *Should have*.

- **Won't have *(at this time)* **
  - *Won't have* (it at this time) are the requirements that the team agreed to have it in the project but not at this delivery time. However, these requirements are often scheduled for the next delivery.
   - Often Won't have is known as **Would have** but this terminology is slightly incorrect since the requirements are often out of scope hence, it is the last priority.
