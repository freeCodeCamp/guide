## Window Location

The window.location object can be used to get the current page address (URL) and to redirect the browser to a new page.


The window.location object can be written without the window prefix.

Some examples:

`window.location.href` returns the href (URL) of the current page
`window.location.hostname` returns the domain name of the web host
`window.location.pathname` returns the path and filename of the current page
`window.location.protocol` returns the web protocol used (http: or https:)
`window.location.assign` loads a new document
