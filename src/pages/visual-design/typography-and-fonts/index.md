## Typography And Fonts

#### Typography
Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing, and letter-spacing, and adjusting the space between pairs of letters. The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography, most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. 

PART-1 Where to choose fonts
Fonts are readily available across patforms. I personally suggest going through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/) as a platform to explore what families are available and how they can be used for different purposes.

PART-2 How to choose fonts 
Fonts are a never ending subject, yet to simplify for your first subject let me hand you some basics

*Choose condensed fonts for headings and sub-headings as their short letter-spacing focuses more attention on the words rather than letters giving a louder appeal. Example [Roboto Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed), [Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu+Condensed), [Fire Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans+Extra+Condensed)

*Choose serif fonts for large amount of paragraph based text. If you have a blog, this is usually the best choice. For long texts with equivalent attention needs, these typefaces suit best becuase these are not clingy to the eye and are natural in feel. The curves provide the wanted aesthetic without distracting the attention from the content which remains the top priority. You might have noticed these in magazines, newspapers etc. Example [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather), [Crimson Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Text), [Nota Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Serif)

*Always go for the main font of a family for short texts and descriptions, work with the font weights to vary the amount of attention needed. These are highly preferred for web usage having descriptions and infromation which is crisp and short. They are not used as sub-headings but mainly as short paragraphs having the core information. Example [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto), [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans), [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato)

*For the main heading of a webpage or landing page go for a display font, I have put them at the end of the list because they are the hardest to choose. They vary if your brand is playful and joyous or serious and stern. Whatever it is, the display font can do a real good job of bringing your point across, if chosen properly. I browse through entire libraries to get that one font, and it does wonders, believe me. Here are some examples to help you. Blogs- [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab), [Lobster Two](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lobster+Two) Information Brochures- [Comfortaa](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa) [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)



These are the basics to help you choose fonts for your first project. Remember that your creativity is the only limit for you when it comes to a subject like this. Keep experimenting and you will hit the spot. Hope this helped.Thanks a lot
