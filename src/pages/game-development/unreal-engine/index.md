## Game Development with Unreal Engine

Unreal Engine is a cross-platform game engine developed by Epic Games. The Unreal Engine was initially developed for the 1998 FPS title Unreal, but has been subsequently used for many thousands of commercial and non commercial titles. The most recent version of the engine, Unreal Engine 4, targets PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Mac OS X, iOS, Android, many VR systems, Linux, SteamOS, and HTML5, and the editor can run on Windows, OS X and Linux.

Since 2015 the Unreal Engine has been free to use, with Epic charging a 5% royalty on sales of titles produced using the engine. Epic make the majority of their codebase freely available via their Github, although source for closed platforms such as the Playstation 4 and Xbox One is only available for registered platform developers.

### Unreal Versions
Unreal has gone through 4 major revisions. Although some code is common between releases, each major version is a separate engine and projects can not be moved between them. Within each major engine release, there are multiple minor versions.

  * Unreal Engine 1
  Released in 1998 and targeted Windows PC, Linux, Mac, Playstation 2 and Dreamcast. The engine was written in C++, and easily moddable using the Unreal Script language.

  * Unreal Engine 2
  Released in 1998 and targeted Windows PC, Linux, Mac, Playstation 2 and Xbox. The engine was written in C++, utilized the Unreal Script language.

  * Unreal Engine 3
  Released in 1998 and targeted Windows PC, Linux, Mac, iOS, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.  Development is split between Unreal Script and C++, with an additional visual scripting interface called Kismet.

  * Unreal Engine 4
  Released in 2015 and targets PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Mac OS X, iOS, Android, many VR systems, Linux, SteamOS, and HTML5, and the editor can run on Windows, OS X and Linux. Unreal Script has been removed and replaced with dynamically reloaded C++ modules, and a more advanced visual scripting interface called Blueprints.
  
## UnrealScript

UnrealScript (often abbreviated to UScript) is Unreal Engine's native scripting language used for authoring game code and gameplay events before the release of Unreal Engine 4. The language was designed for simple, high-level game programming.The UnrealScript interpreter was programmed by Tim Sweeney, who also created an earlier game scripting language, ZZT-oop.

Similar to Java, UnrealScript is object-oriented without multiple inheritance (classes all inherit from a common Object class), and classes are defined in individual files named for the class they define. Unlike Java, UnrealScript does not have object wrappers for primitive types. Interfaces are only supported in Unreal Engine generation 3 and a few Unreal Engine 2 games. UnrealScript supports operator overloading, but not method overloading, except for optional parameters.

In March 2014, Epic announced that the Unreal Engine 4 would no longer be supporting UnrealScript, but instead support game scripting in C++. Visual scripting would be supported by the Blueprints Visual Scripting system, a replacement for the earlier Kismet visual scripting system.
