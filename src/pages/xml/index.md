## Extensible Markup Language (XML)

  XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. It is extensible, because it does not use a predefined set of tags for identifying structural components, instead, it provides a mechanism for defining such sets of tags. The main purpose of the language is to share the data. Unlike HTML, in XML there is no predefined set of tags and tags specify meaning, rather than the presentation.
  
  * Advantages of using XML:
    * Simplicity - XML documents are ordinary text files that can be created and edited with any text editor.
    * Vendor independence
    * Platform independence
    * Extensive infrastructure
  
 * Disadvantages of using XML:
   * Verbose and cumbersome syntax
   * Highly inefficient storage  

### Difference between HTML and XML
One can easily confuse HTML and XML at one glance as how similar they both look. But there are a lot of differences between them. HTML focuses on the display and more importantly how data looks whereas XML is a software and hardware independent tool used to transport and store data, with focus on what data is. Syntactically, HTML is case insensitive but XML is case sensitive

### Applications of XML
Applications for XML are endless. For example, computer makers might agree upon a standard or common way to describe the information about a computer product (processor speed, memory size, and so forth) and then describe the product information format with XML code. Such a standard way of describing data would enable a user to send an intelligent agent (a program) to each computer maker's Web site, gather data, and then make a valid comparison.
