## A Href Attribute

The `<a href>` atrribute refers to a destination provided by a link. The `a` tag is dead without `<href>`. It's useful to work without a link because which is not neccesary at the moment, so what we do is to put instead a link, the `#` to kill the hyperlink.

The `<a href>` attributes is supported by all browsers.
### Example
<a href="#">Link dead</a>
`<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com">FreecodeCamp</a>`
