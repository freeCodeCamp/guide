title: Comment Out HTML
---
Commenting is a way that you can leave comments within your code without affecting the code itself.

It is also a convenient way to make code inactive without having to delete it entirely.

You can start a comment with `<!-- and end a comment with -->`.
```html
    <!--
    <h1>Hello World</h1>

    <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

    <p>Hello Paragraph</p>
    -->
```
