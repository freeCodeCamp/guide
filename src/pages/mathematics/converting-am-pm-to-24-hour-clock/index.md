As shown in the table above, from 12:00 AM until 12.00 PM the notation is similar between 12-hour clock system and 24-hour clock system. But start from 01.00 PM until 11.00 PM, we need to add 12 hours. Fun thing about 12 hours system is we do not to include AM nor PM to differentiate between day or night.

#### More Examples:
04:30 AM = 04:30

12.45 AM = 12:45

01:28 PM = 13:28

11.59 PM = 23:59
