Sometimes we all need a break. This is also true when coding an HTML document and you find you need a break or <br> tag in order to create a single line break in your content. 

The <br> tag is a standalone tag that does not require an end tag. 

Example:
  <p>This sentence contains<br>a line break.</p>
<!-- when the page renders in the browser the text will then look like this -->

This sentence contains
a line break.
