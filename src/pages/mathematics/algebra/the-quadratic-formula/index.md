## The Quadratic Formula

### The proof 
The derivation of the formula is just as important as the application. By understanding this you would be able to tell whether or not you even need to use the formula or can the equation be solved simply by completing the square. 

The quadratic formula is nothing but the general case of solving a quadratic equation via completing the square as you will see below.
