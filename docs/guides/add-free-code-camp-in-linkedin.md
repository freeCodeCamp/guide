LinkedIn recognizes Free Code Camp as a university.

You can explore our alumni activity [here](https://www.linkedin.com/edu/school?id=166029).

You should add Free Code Camp to your LinkedIn profile. Here's how:

*   Follow this link: [Add Free Code Camp](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/edit-education?school=Free+Code+Camp)

Once you complete our curriculum (or complete at least one Nonprofit Project and then get a coding job), we will issue you an official Full Stack Web Development certificate that you can also add to your LinkedIn profile.
