## How to Redirect a Web Page

Redirecting a webpage is easy! You can copy this code into your html file's(with a few minor changes) head.

```
<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="5;url=https://stevencopeland.github.io/new-website/">
```

Replace `content=5` with number of seconds until the website changes. Replace https://stevencopeland.github.io/new-website/ with what website you want. Rember to place this code in your head: `<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="5;url=https://stevencopeland.github.io/new-website/">`
