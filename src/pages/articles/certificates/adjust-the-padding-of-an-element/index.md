title: Adjust the Padding of An Element
---
HTML elements are essentially little rectangles. Three important attributes control the space that surrounds each HTML element: `padding`, `margin`, and `border`. An element's padding controls the amount of space between the element and its border.

    .green-box {
      background-color: green;
      padding: 20px;
    }
