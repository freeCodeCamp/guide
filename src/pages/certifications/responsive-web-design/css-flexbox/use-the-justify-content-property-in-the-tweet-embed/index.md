## Use the justify-content Property in the Tweet Embed

The different values for `justify-content` from the previous challenge are:

- `flex-start` aligns items to the start of the flex container.
- `flex-end` aligns items to the end of the flex container.
- `space-between` aligns items to the center of the main axis, with extra space placed between the items.
- `space-around` similar to `space-between` but the space is distributed around all the items.
