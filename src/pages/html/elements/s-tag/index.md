## S Tag

The "<s>" tag is an HTML element that when used, will create a line through the text it is applied to.  These lines, or <em>strikethroughs</em> specify that the text is no longer accurate.  Below is an example of the <s> tag:
  
  <p><s>This year is the year of the monkey.</s></p>
  <p>This year is the year of the Rooster.</p>
