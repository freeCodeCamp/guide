## Integration Hell

Integration hell refers to the practice of integrating the different components of a project at the end of the project. The idea was that the specifications would completely describe the ways the components could interact, and that integration would be quick and easy.

In practice, the longer components are developed in isolation, the more the interfaces tend to diverge from what is expected. When the components are finally integrated at the end of the project, it would take a great deal more time than allocated, often leading to deadline pressures, and difficult integration. This painful integration work at the end of the project is the eponymous hell.
