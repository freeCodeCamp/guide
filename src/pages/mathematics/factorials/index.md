## Factorials

A factorial is the product of values multipled from 1 to a particular value value, n.

For example, 4! is equivalent to 1 * 2 * 3 * 4, where n = 4.

0 is NOT included when calculating the factorial, for, multiplying any value by zero will result in the entire expression euating to zero.
