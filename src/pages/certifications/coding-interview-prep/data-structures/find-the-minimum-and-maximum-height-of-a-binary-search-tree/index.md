## Find the Minimum and Maximum Height of a Binary Search Tree

Every modern web browser includes a powerful suite of developer tools. These tools do a range of things, from inspecting currently-loaded HTML, CSS and JavaScript to showing which assets the page has requested and how long they took to load. Some of the main features are listed below:

* Access to  a browser console
* Test Responsive and Device-specific Viewports
* Edit the DOM
* Debugging
* Analyse network activity
* Understand security issues

and much more...

## How to Open Development Tools
### Keyboard

Ctrl + Shift + I
```
### Menu bar
#### Firefox
```
Tools ➤ Web Developer ➤ Toggle Tools
```
#### Chrome / Chromium
```
Tools ➤ Developer Tools
```
#### Safari
```
Develop ➤ Show Web Inspector.
```
If you can't see the Develop menu, go to
```Safari ➤ Preferences ➤ Advanced```
and check the ```Show Develop menu``` in menu bar checkbox.

#### Opera
```
Developer ➤ Web Inspector
```
### Context menu
```Right-click``` an item on a webpage (Ctrl-click on the Mac), and choose ```Inspect Element``` from the context menu that appears.

This method straight-away highlights the code of the element you right-clicked.
