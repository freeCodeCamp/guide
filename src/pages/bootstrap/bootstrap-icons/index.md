## Bootstrap Icons

The Bootstrap framework provides you with over 250 icons called glyphs. They come in font format from the Glyphicon Halflings set.

#### How To Use:

To use bootstrap icons you simply create `<span>` tag and apply the applicable CSS class for the icon. A code example has been provided below.

**Code Example:**

`<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search" aria-hidden="true"></span>`
