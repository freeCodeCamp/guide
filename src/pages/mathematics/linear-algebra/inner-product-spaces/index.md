###### INNER PRODUCT SPACE
##### Introduction
Let V be a vector space over field F. An inner product is a function that assigns to every ordered pair of vector x and y in V, a scalar in F, denoted by <x,y> such that for all x,y in V and a in F these hold:
*<x+z,y>=<x,y>+<x,z>
*<ax,y>=a<x,y>
*<X,Y>=<y,x> (X and Y denote conjugate of x and y respectively)
*<x,x>=0 for all x!=0
