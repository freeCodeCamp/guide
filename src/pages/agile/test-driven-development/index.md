## Test Driven Development

Test Driven Development (TDD) is one of Agile Software Development approaches. It is based on the concept that
> you must write a test case for your code even before you write the code

It's basically composed of 4 steps

 - Write a test case
 - Execute
 - If fails, adjust your code
 - If pass, development continues

Each new feature of your system should follow the steps above.
