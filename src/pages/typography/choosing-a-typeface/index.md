When selecting a typeface, one of the first things that needs to be considered is legibility. Legibility is the design of the typeface that allows for the recognition of letters. If your writing is ment to be read for a long time such as a parahraph or book, then a novelty font with low legibility would not support the viewer. On the other end of the spectrum, if you are only makeing a title or headline with limited reading can afford more novelty typefaces with less legibility. Readability is the interaction that allows for multiple letters to be combined for reading.

Addressing the concepts of legibility and readability directly relate to the experience of the viewer. When selecting a typeface, addressing the context that the text will be read will help determine the typefaces best suited for the job. Some qestions to consider to help select a typeface are:

1. What is the mood?
2. How will the viewer interact with the text?
3. What is the text hierarchy?
4. How have others in similar situations selected typefaces?
