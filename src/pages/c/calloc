# Library function - calloc()

One way for dynamic memory allocation in C is to use a library function calloc() defined under <stdlib.h>. 
Calloc() allocates requested memory and initializes it to 0.

## Syntax

Calloc() takes two arguments: number of memory blocks to be allocated and the size of each block:
void *calloc(size_t ntimes, size_t size)

## Example
```
int *ptr;
```
This is a pointer for our array.
```
a = (int*)calloc(5, sizeof(int));
```
Using calloc() we allocated memory for an array of 5 integers each size of int (4 bytes). 

To release space allocated for our array, we must use free().
```
free(ptr);
```
