We can align our text in paragraphs Left, Right, Center, or Justify by using examples like
---
`<p align="type in left, right, center, or justify here"> Type your text here </p>`

We can apply the same format to other attributes like img tags. For example
---
`<img align="type in left, right, center, or justify here"> </img>`

all we did was change the p tag to img tag
