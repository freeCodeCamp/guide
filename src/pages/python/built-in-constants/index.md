Some commonly used built-in constants:

*   `True`: The true value of the _bool_ type.
*   `False`: The false value of the _bool_ type.
*   `None` : The sole value of the type _NoneType_. None is frequently used to represent the absence of a value, as when default arguments are not passed to a function.
*   `NotImplemented` : Special value which can be returned by the “rich comparison” special methods (__eq__(), __lt__(), and friends), to indicate that the comparison is not implemented with respect to the other type.
*   `Ellipsis` : Special value used in conjunction with extended slicing syntax.
*   `__debug__` : This constant is true if Python was not started with an -O option.
