 ## Plugins

A jQuery plugin is a new method that is added to the jQuery prototype object.

One of the many benefits to the jQuery library is the extensive and diverse amount of plugins available. Plugins can help you do things ranging from creating an interactive tour of a site(<a href="http://technoplugin.com/SiteHelp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SiteHelp.js</a>) to creating an easier way to manage date inputs(<a href="http://felicegattuso.com/projects/datedropper/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Date Dropper</a>).

If you are interested in exploring plugins registered with the official jQuery website you can search their site <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
