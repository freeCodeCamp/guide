## Area of a Triangle

The area of a triangle can be calculated by multiplying the height by <span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span> the base (width).

For example, if you have a triangle that is 4cm wide and 3cm high, then the area would be calculated like this:

(<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span> x 4cm) x 3cm = 6cm²

or more concisely:

<span class="fraction"><sup>4cm x 3cm</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span> = 6cm²
