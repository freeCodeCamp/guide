## Iterate with JavaScript While Loops
While loops will run as long as the condition inside the ( ) is true.
Example:
```javascript
while(condition){
code...
}
```

## Hint 1:
Use a iterator variable such as i in your condition
```javascript
var i = 0;
while(i <= 4){
}
```

## Spoiler Alert Solution Ahead!

## Solution:

```javascript
// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.
var i = 0;
while (i <= 4){
    myArray.push(i);
    i++;
}

```
