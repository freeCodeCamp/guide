title: Img Src Attribute

## Img Src Attribute
The `<img src>` atrribute refers to source of the image you want to display. The img tag is useless without the `src` attribute. It won't display an image. However, if we set the source to something, we can display any image. 

For example, there is an image of the freeCodeCamp Logo located at `https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9892522?v=4&s=400`

We can set that as our image using the `src` attribute

For Instance:
```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Img Src Attribute Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9892522?v=4&s=400">
  </body>
</html>
```
That Piece of code displays this:

#### More Information:
- The `src` attribute is supported by all browsers.
- You can have a locally hosted file as your image as well. E.g `<img src="images/freeCodeCamp.jpeg>`. This would work if you had a folder called images with that image inside in the same file as your `index.html` file.
