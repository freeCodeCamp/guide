## User Acceptance Tests

User Acceptance Tests (UAT) are part of the software development lifecycle. UAT is the fourth, last step in the 4 step testing process. The 4 steps: unit testing, integration testing, system testing and then acceptance testing. 
In UAT clients confirm if the software under testing (SUT) meets  business needs. UAT decide if the developer team can release the SUT to the next step.
