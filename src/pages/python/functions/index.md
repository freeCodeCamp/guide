## Functions

A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a specific task. Functions help us with better modularity and code reusability.

#### Syntax of function declaration

```python
def function_name(parameters):
	"""docstring"""
	statement(s)
  
```

#### Example Function

```python
def sum(a, b):
	"""This function add the two
     numbers passed in as parameter
     and prints them. """
	print("Sum = " , a+b)

```

#### Calling a function

```python
>>> sum(4,5)
Sum =  5

```
