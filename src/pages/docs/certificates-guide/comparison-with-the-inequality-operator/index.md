The inequality operator (`!=`) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means "Not Equal" and returns `false` where equality would return `true` and vice versa. Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

## Examples

    1 != 2      // true
    1 != "1"    // false
    1 != '1'    // false
    1 != true   // false
    0 != false  // false
