The input tag is the most awesome tag in the form element family. It allows you to create buttons, submit buttons, input elements, color selectors, and radio buttons and checkboxes.

Here are some examples:

```
<input type="radio" name="radio" />
<input type="checkbox" name="checkbox" />
<input type="input" name="input" />
```
These tags go between a [Form tag](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/html/elements/form-tag) which contains the content.

It is an awesome tag because it allows you to do more then one thing just using one element.
