title: Finding Circumference of a Circle When Given the Area
---
## Background information

### Area (A) of a Circle

A = π * radius<sup>2</sup>

### Circumference (C) of a Circle

C = 2 * π * radius

## To find the Circumference of a Circle given the area

1. Solve for the radius of the circle

    radius = (A / π)<sup>½</sup>

2. Input the radius into the formula for the circumference and solve. 

    C = 2 * π * (A / π)<sup>½</sup>
