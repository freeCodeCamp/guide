## Bootstrap Panels

The Bootstrap framework provides you with a feature called panels. A panel is a box that has a styled heading and then a body that allows you to display information in an organized manner, through a set of one or more panels.

#### How To Use:
To use Bootstrap Panels you add a `<div>` with a class for your type of panel (class `panel panel-default` or something similar, see the panel examples for more information.) and then two nested `<div>` tags, one for the heading (class `panel panel-heading`) and one for the body (class `panel panel-body`). You may find that the Code Example is easier to understand than a written explanation.

**Code Example**
```html
<div class="panel panel-primary">
  <div class="panel panel-heading">Panel Primary</div>
  <div class="panel panel-body"> This is a panel with the primary panel style.</div>
</div>
```

#### Panel Examples:
This is a set of examples that shows each type of panel. The CSS Class is displayed above each example.
