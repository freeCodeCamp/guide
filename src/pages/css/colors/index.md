CSS supports color names, hexadecimal and RGB colors.

In addition, CSS3 also introduces:

    RGBA colors
    HSL colors
    HSLA colors
    opacity

RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An RGBA color value is specified with: rgba(red, green, blue, alpha). The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).

HSL Colors

HSL stands for Hue, Saturation and Lightness.

An HSL color value is specified with: hsl(hue, saturation, lightness).

    Hue is a degree on the color wheel (from 0 to 360):
        0 (or 360) is red
        120 is green
        240 is blue
    Saturation is a percentage value: 100% is the full color.
    Lightness is also a percentage; 0% is dark (black) and 100% is white.

HSLA Colors

HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An HSLA color value is specified with: hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha), where the alpha parameter defines the opacity. The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).

Opacity

The CSS3 opacity property sets the opacity for the whole element (both background color and text will be opaque/transparent).

The opacity property value must be a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).
