A software development kit (SDK) is a programming package that enables a programmer to develop applications for a specific platform. It is typically a set of software development tools that allows the creation of applications for a certain software package, software framework, hardware platform, computer system, video game console, operating system, or similar development. 

For example : 
* the development of an Android app on Java platform requires a Java Development Kit, 
* for iOS apps the iOS SDK, and 
* for Universal Windows Platform the .NET Framework SDK. 

There are also SDKs that are installed in apps to provide analytics and data about activity. Prominent examples include Google, InMobi and Facebook.
