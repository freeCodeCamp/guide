## Color and Usability

The overall experience a person has when viewing your page is also determined by the color selection youâ€™ve made. For example, using light-gray or yellow color text on a white background makes it very tough for most people to read. This is due to a lack of contrast between the colors. Black text on a white background or white text on a blue background conversely has high contrast and will be easier to read.

Individuals who are affected by color-blindness might not be able to differentiate between similar colors as easily as you either. What you perceive as a wonderful palette of greens and blues might appear gray, beige, and dull to someone else. Importantly, if you choose a text color that views well for you, it might have much lower contrast than you realize to someone else, making it harder to understand the content you are trying to display.
