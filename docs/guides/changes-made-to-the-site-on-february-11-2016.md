## Fixing the bottlenecks that made FreeCodeCamp.com so slow

*   Our open source community is growing rapidly, and this week our site has slowed to a crawl during peak hours.
*   We've gone through, identified several bottlenecks, and fixed them. Free Code Camp should now be faster than ever.
*   A huge thanks to [@berkeleytrue](https://gitter.im/berkeleytrue) for leading this effort, and to the many campers who helped QA these improvements.

## Introducing our new Wiki

*   Our wiki is now on FreeCodeCamp.com itself (as opposed to on our main project's GitHub Wiki).
*   Our wiki pops out like our chat and map do. We welcome feedback on this new functionality. Hotkeys, context aware wiki articles, and other features will come soon.
*   A big thanks to [@saintpeter](https://gitter.im/saintpeter), [@hallaathrad](https://gitter.im/hallaathrad), and [@awesomeaniruddh](https://gitter.im/awesomeaniruddh), along with many other campers for their hard work on this!

## Opening our Shop

*   We have a new t-shirt campaign going on until February 15\. Hurry up and buy one of these awesome Free Code Camp t-shirts: [click here for our US campaign](https://teespring.com/free-code-camp-feb) | [click here for our EU campaign](https://teespring.com/free-code-camp-t-shirt-eu-shop)
*   We created a new shop page. It only links to our t-shirt campaign now, but we will soon have laptop stickers and other cool gear.

## Retiring Camper News

*   Over the past year, Camper News has been a modest success. But so has our subreddit, which allows for commenting, moderation, and many other features. So we are shifting to Reddit for news sharing.
*   We recommend creating a Reddit account if you don't already have one and [joining our subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/freecodecamp). You can now share links with our entire community there, as well as your thoughts and questions.
*   We will keep Camper News live for a while, but we're removing the link to it from our navigation menu, and removing the challenge that introduced it.

## Updating challenges

*   Many campers asked that we create an easier, HTML-focused project to precede "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage". So we've created a new project that can be completed using only HTML and Bootstrap called "Build a Tribute Page".
*   We also resequenced our front end projects. Here's how they're now structured:
    *   Basic Front End Projects
        *   Build a Tribute Page
        *   Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage
    *   Intermediate Front End Projects
        *   Build a Random Quote Machine
        *   Show the Local Weather
        *   Build a Wikipedia Viewer
        *   Use the Twitch.tv JSON API
    *   Advanced Front End Projects
        *   Build a JavaScript Calculator
        *   Build a Pomodoro Clock
        *   Build a Tic Tac Toe Game
        *   Build a Simon Game
*   You'll note that we've removed the "Build a Camper News Viewer" project since we're retiring Camper News. If you've previously completed that challenge, the "Build a Tribute Page" should already be marked completed for you on your map.
*   Also, for "Build a Tic Tac Toe Game", you no longer need to make it unbeatable. (You certainly can if you want - [here's how](http://neverstopbuilding.com/minimax). Although doing so is a useful exercise, writing an AI is a departure from the project's focus, which is front end development.
*   We added three new optional challenges that help you join our:
    *   [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/freecodecamp)
    *   [Medium publication](https://medium.freecodecamp.com)
    *   [Twitch.tv channel](https://twitch.tv/freecodecamp)

## Coming soon

*   We will launch our Spanish challenges in the next few days.
*   We plan to release optional React, Sass, and D3 challenges this Spring. But don't wait - you can complete the projects with the help of these projects' official documentation - 16 campers have already done just that.
