## Change Styles Based on Data

Remind yourself once again what is the callback function

With this

There is two ways you can complete this part: either with if-else logic or ternary operator. 

 if-else logic

An example from w3school

```javascript 

const money = 50;

if (money < 50) {

  return "I\'m rich";

}

else {

  return "I`'m poor";

}

```

What you need to remember is the bracket that the if-else logic associate with, (argument) and {statement}

Try Yourself Now

Ternary operator

A more detailed explanation here

```javascript 

condition ? value if true : value if false 

```
