## Hexcodes

In mathematics and computing, hexadecimal (also base 16, or hex) is a positional numeral system with a radix, or base, of 16. It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0â€“9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F (or alternatively a, b, c, d, e, f) to represent values ten to fifteen.

Hex colors are broken up into six hexadecimal digits. There are three sections - Red, Green, and Blue (in that order). Each section is a number from 00 to FF. The higher the number/letter, the more of that color you have.

There are 16,777,216 possible color combinations using hexcode.

#### Examples:

Pure red is FF0000
Pure green is 00FF00
Pure blue is 0000FF
Black is 000000
White is FFFFFF
