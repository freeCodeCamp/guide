## Mode

#### Definition:
Mode is the most frequently occurring number found in a set of numbers. The mode is found by collecting and organizing the data in order to count the frequency of each result. The result with the highest occurrences is the mode of the set. 

#### Example:
In the set [7, 43, 32, 7, 32, 67,7, 32, 43, 32, 32], 32 appears the highest number of times and hence the mode of this set is 32.

It is one of the three ways of calculating a central tendency of a data set along with mean and median.
