title: Set Front Family of An Element

Font family is controlled by the `font-family` CSS attribute, like this `h1 {font-family: Sans-serif;}`

It allows you to pick a font to display to the user.

More font-family examples can be viewed at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family)

**_Note_**: Keep in mind that different computers and browsers will have different fonts enabled. Commonly available fonts are called _Web Safe_
