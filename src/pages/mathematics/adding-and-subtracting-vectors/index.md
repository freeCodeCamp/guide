## Adding and Subtracting Vectors

Given two vectors `a=[x1, y1]` and `b=[x2, y2]`, we can perform the action of addition and subtraction the following way:

# Adding vectors

`a + b = [x1 + x2, y1 + y2]`

# Subtracting vectors

`a - b = [x1 - x2, y1 - y2]`

#### NOTE: we can extend it to whatever many dimensions we want.
