## JavaScript

JavaScript is the most widely used scripting language on Earth. And it has the largest library ecosystem of any programming language. 

JavaScript is the core language of the web, and the only programming language that can run in all major web browsers. With the release of Node js environment, javascript also gained the ability to be ran on server side. Today Javascript can be used to make interactive web pages, set up back-end logic, create mobile apps, create desktop apps with electron framework and much much more. Some of the brightest minds of the world are constantly working to improve this language under the name of ECMAScript (which you might come across as Es6, Es7 etc. )
