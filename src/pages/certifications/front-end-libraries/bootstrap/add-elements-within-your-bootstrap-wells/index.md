## Add Elements within Your Bootstrap Wells

In the last challenge, you had created a div with the well class, this challenge now requires you to add 3 button elements in each of the wells.

### Hint

A button is declared as follows:
```html
<button></button>
```

### Solution

Since we have to declare 3 button in each well, we would do the following:

```html
<div class="container-fluid">
  <h3 class="text-primary text-center">jQuery Playground</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <div class="well">
        <button></button>
        <button></button>
        <button></button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <div class="well">
        <button></button>
        <button></button>
        <button></button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
