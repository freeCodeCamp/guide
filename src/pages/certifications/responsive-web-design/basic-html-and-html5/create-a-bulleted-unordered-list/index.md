## Create a Bulleted Unordered List

To pass the challenge the first operation you should do is to remove the `p` elements with all their content.

After that you have to implement the list: it must contains at least three `li` element inside the `ul` element and these `li` must be on the same level, not nested into each other:

Correct: 
```
<ul>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
```
Not correct: 
```
<ul>
  <li>
    <li>
    </li>
  </li>
</ul>
```

Good luck!
