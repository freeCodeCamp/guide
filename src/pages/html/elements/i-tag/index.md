## I Tag

The `<i>` element is used to denote text that is set apart from its surrounding text in some way. By default, text surrounded by `<i>` tags will be displayed in italic type. 

In previous HTML specifications, the `<i>` tag was solely used to denote text to be italicized. In modern semantic HTML, however, tags such as `<em>` and `<strong>` should be used where appropriate. You can use the "class" attribute of the `<i>` element to state why the text in the tags is different from the surrounding text. You may want to show that the text or phrase is from a different language, as in the example below.

```HTML
<p>The French phrase <i class="french">esprit de corps</i> is often 
used to describe a feeling of group cohesion and fellowship.</p>
```
