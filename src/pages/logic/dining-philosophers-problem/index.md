This logic problem states that there is five philosophers at a table. They can perform two functions, eating and thinking. The table is also set with 5 single chopsticks. The rules of the problem state that a philosopher can only eat with two chopsticks one on his right and one ons his left. If the philospher thinks he puts down the chopsticks back in their original place.

There is some problems with this configuration, if all five philosophers are hungry simultaneously, and each of them pickup one chopstick, then a deadlock situation occurs. This problem is used as a thought-experiment to design solutions for algortihms that define behavouir for applicaitons that use resources. The idea is that we keep alternating a philospher between eating and thinking and no deadlock occurs.
