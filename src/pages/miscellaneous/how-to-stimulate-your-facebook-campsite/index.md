title: How to Stimulate Your Facebook Campsite
---
A great way to stimulate your Local Group is by asking questions.

**You can ask questions like**

*   What is everyone working on this week?
*   How did you approach a specific Challenge, Algorithm, Front End Project, Back End Project?
*   Would anyone be interested in meeting up to pair program together this week?
*   Did everyone hear about "insert recent announcement"
*   What are some parts of free code camp you'd like to give additional focus to?

**You can also provide useful links for other members to relevant resources that you find helpful.**
