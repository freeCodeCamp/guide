## Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design is the concept of designing web pages that adapt to different screen sizes. It commonly involves the use of different layouts, font sizes, and placement of navigation menus.

In order to create a responsive web page, CSS is commonly used to style your HTML elements. Some common methods in CSS used to create responsive web designs are:

1. Writing [media queries](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/css/media-queries)
2. Using pre-existing [CSS frameworks](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/css/css-frameworks)
3. Using the [Flexbox model](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/css/layout/flexbox)
4. Using [CSS Grid](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/css/layout/grid-layout)
