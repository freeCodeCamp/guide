# C# For Loop

The for loop is similar to the while loop in the sense that it executes your
statement repetitively while the condition is true. The example below will
print a number from 0 to 4.

## Example
```
for (var i = 0; i < 5; ++i) 
{
    Console.WriteLine("Number " + i);
}
```

## Output:
```
> Number 0
> Number 1
> Number 2
> Number 3
> Number 4
```
