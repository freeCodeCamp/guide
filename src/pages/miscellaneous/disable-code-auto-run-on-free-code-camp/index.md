title: Disable Code Auto Run on Free Code Camp
---
By default, the Free Code Camp site automatically loads and runs your last recorded solution. If you have accidentally created an infinite loop or other irrecoverable error or simply don't trust the code, you can disable code auto-run by putting the following in your URL: `run=disabled`

## Example:

URL: `http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/Algorithm-meet-Algorithm#?solution=function%20meetBonfire(argument)`

No-Run URL: `http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/Algorithm-meet-Algorithm#?run=disabled&solution=function%20meetBonfire(argument)`
