## Blockchain

A blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the collusion of the network. 
These transactions can be any movement of money, goods or secure dataâ€”a purchase at a supermarket, for example, or the assignment of a government ID number.

It combines the openness of the internet with the security of cryptography to give everyone a faster, safer way to verify key information and establish trust.
