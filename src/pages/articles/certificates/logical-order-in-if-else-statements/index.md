title: Logical Order in if Else Statements
---
Order is important in `if`, `else if` and `else` statements.

The loop is executed from top to bottom so you will want to be careful of which statement comes first.

Take these two functions as an example.

## Examples:

    function foo(x) {
      if (x < 1) {
        return "Less than one";
        } 
      else if (x < 2) {
        return "Less than two";
        } 
      else {
        return "Greater than or equal to two";
        }
    }

And the second just switches the order of the statements:

    function bar(x) {
      if (x < 2) {
        return "Less than two";
        } 
      else if (x < 1) {
        return "Less than one";
        }
      else {
        return "Greater than or equal to two";
        }
    }

While these two functions look nearly identical, if we pass a number to both we get different outputs.

    foo(0) // "Less than one" 

    bar(0) // "Less than two"

So be careful while using the `if`, `else if` and `else` statements and always remember that these are executed from top to bottom. Keep this in mind placing your statements accordingly so that you get the desired output.
