Given a data set, the mean of the data set is defined as the sum of the data members divided by the number of data members. Mean and average mean the same quantity.

The mean is the average of a set of data. The mean is found by finding the sum of the data and then dividing the sum by the number of data.

#### Formula to find the mean of a data set
```
      Mean = Sum of the Data / Number of Data
```

For Example, Mean of the set of numbers 16, 14, 3, 2, 5, 4, 2, 15, 2 Will be
```
    Mean = (16 + 14 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 2 + 15 + 2) / 9 
         = 63 / 9 
         = 7
```
