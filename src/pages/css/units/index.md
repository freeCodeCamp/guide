## Units

Many CSS properties like `width`, `margin`, `padding`, `font-size` etc. take length. CSS has a way to express length in multiple units. Length is a combination of a number and unit with no whitespace. E.g. `5px`, `0.9em` etc.

| Unit          | Description             |
|---------------|-----------------------|
|em             |1 em is the computed value of the font-size on the element on which it is used.	|
|ex             |1 ex is the current font’s x-height. The x-height is usually (but not always, e.g., if there is no ‘x’ in the font) equal to the height of a lowercase ‘x’	|
|ch             |1 ch is the advance of the ‘0’ (zero) glyph in the current font. ‘ch’ stands for character.	|
|rem            |1 rem is the computed value of the font-size property for the document’s root element.|
|vw             |1vw is 1% of the width of the viewport. ‘vw’ stands for ‘viewport width’.	|
|vh             |1vh is 1% of the height of the viewport. ‘vh’ stands for ‘viewport height’.	|
|vmin           |Equal to the smaller of ‘vw’ or ‘vh’	|
|vmax           |Equal to the larger of ‘vw’ or ‘vh’	|
