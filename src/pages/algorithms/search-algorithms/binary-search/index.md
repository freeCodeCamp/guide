## Binary Search
<p>A binary search locates an item in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.</p>

<p>The initial interval includes the entire array.</p>

<p>If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, then the next interval will be the lower half of the current interval.</p>
<p>If the value of the search key is greater than the middle item, then the next interval will be the upper half.</p>

<p>The search process repeats until the item is found or the search interval is empty.</p>
