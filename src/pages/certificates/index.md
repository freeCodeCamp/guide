## Certificates

freeCodeCamp offers verified web development certificates for free to anyone who can complete each certificate's required projects.

There are six different certificates:
<ul>
  <li>Responsive Web Design</li>
  <li>Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
  <li>Front End Libraries</li>
  <li>Data Visualization</li>
  <li>APIs and Microservices</li>
  <li>Information Security and Quality Assurance</li>
</ul>

Each of these certificates will have 5 required projects, and all other challenges will be optional.
Once you earn all 6 of these certificates, freeCodeCamp awards you with the Full Stack Development Certificate. This final distinction signifies that youâ€™ve completed around 1,800 hours of coding with a wide range of web development tools.

In this folder, you'll find guides to hundreds of freeCodeCamp coding challenges and projects.
