## Storyboards

Storyboards are low-fidelity, sequential images or blocks of text used to walk a persona through a scenario. The scenario you're walking your user through can be good or bad - a problem or a solution - or just a task relevant to your project. It's important to remember that storyboards are not technical, but focus on helping the designer to discover features, role-play solutions and catch errors before they happen.
