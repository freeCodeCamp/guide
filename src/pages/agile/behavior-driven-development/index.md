## Behavior Driven Development

Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is a software development process that emerged from ![Test Driven Development (TDD)](../test-driven-development/index.md).
Behavior Driven Development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.
It is a software development methodology in which an application is specified and designed by describing how its behavior should appear to an outside observer.

Although BDD is principally an idea about how software development should be managed by both business interests and technical insight, the practice of BDD does assume the use of specialized software tools to support the development process.

Although these tools are often developed specifically for use in BDD projects, they can be seen as specialized forms of the tooling that supports test-driven development. The tools serve to add automation to the ubiquitous language that is a central theme of BDD.

BDD focuses on:
- Where to start in the process
- What to test and what not to test
- How much to test in one go
- What to call the tests
- How to understand why a test fails

At the heart of BDD is a rethinking of the approach to the unit testing and acceptance testing that naturally arise with these issues. 
For example, BDD suggests that unit test names be whole sentences starting with a conditional verb ("should" in English for example) and should be written in order of business value. 
Acceptance tests should be written using the standard agile framework of a user story: "As a _role_ I want _feature_ so that _benefit_".
Acceptance criteria should be written in terms of scenarios and implemented as classes: Given _initial context_, when _event occurs_, then _ensure some outcomes_.

Example

```
Story: Returns go to stock

As a store owner
In order to keep track of stock
I want to add items back to stock when they're returned.

Scenario 1: Refunded items should be returned to stock
Given that a customer previously bought a black sweater from me
And I have three black sweaters in stock.
When he returns the black sweater for a refund
Then I should have four black sweaters in stock.

Scenario 2: Replaced items should be returned to stock
Given that a customer previously bought a blue garment from me
And I have two blue garments in stock
And three black garments in stock.
When he returns the blue garment for a replacement in black
Then I should have three blue garments in stock
And two black garments in stock.
```
Along with it are some Benefites:

1. All development work can be traced back directly to business objectives.
2. Software development meets user need. Satisfied users = good business.
3. Efficient prioritisation - business-critical features are delivered first.
4. All parties have a shared understanding of the project and can be involved in the communication.
5. A shared language ensures everyone (technical or not) has thorough visibility into the projectâ€™s progression.
6. Resulting software design that matches existing and supports upcoming business needs.
7. Improved quality code reducing costs of maintenance and minimising project risk.
