## CSS3 Opacity Property

Set the opacity level for a DOM element.  
  
The opacity-level describes the transparency-level, where 1 is not transparent at all, 0.5 is 50% see-through, and 0 is completely transparent. Transparency describes the amount of visibility of the element behind the targeted element.

Using opacity with a value other than 1 places the element in a new ![stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context).

Example code for setting a ```<div>``` element opacity to 50%:

```
div {
    opacity: 0.5;
}
```
