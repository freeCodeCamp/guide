## Tensor Flow

<a href='https://www.tensorflow.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>TensorFlow</a> is an open source software library for Machine Intelligence.

With the aim of conducting research in these fascinating areas, the Google team developed TensorFlow.

## Why tensorflow?
TensorFlow is an Open Source machine learning library by Google. It is a way of representing
computation without actually performing it until asked. In this sense, it is a form of lazy
computing, and it allows for some great improvements to the running of code:
* Distributed computation across multiple systems, including GPUs.
* Reduced redundancy in some computations
* Faster computation of complex variables

## What is a Tensor?
TensorFlow is a framework to define and run computations involving tensors. Tensors are
n-dimensional arrays.

## How it is used for Data Science
TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. 
Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the 
multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture 
allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile 
device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers 
working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization 
for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the 
system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.
