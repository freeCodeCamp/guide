## Machine Learning

As a pioneer in artificial intelligence Arthur Samuel defines it in 1959, Machine Learning is "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."

A more formal definition of Machine Learning is provided by Prof Tom Mitchell of CMU:

> "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Consider the example of a Machine Learning algorithm that plays chess. In this example, `E` refers to the experience of playing chess, `T` is the task of playing chess, and `P` denotes the probability that the program will win the next game of chess.

In general, machine learning problems can be classified into supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, you have the input and the labeled output, and you suspect that a relationship exists between the input and the labeled output. When you know neither what the labeled output is nor if a relationship exists, unsupervised learning will help you find structure in your data if there is one.

In sum, there are two broad categories of machine learning

1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning

There are however other subcategories of machine learning you may encounter.
