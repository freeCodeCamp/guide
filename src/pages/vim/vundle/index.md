## Vundle

Vundle is short for Vim bundle and is a Vim plugin manager.

It allows you to...
- keep track of and configure your plugins right in the `~/.vimrc` (a [file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/164847/what-is-in-your-vimrc) to customise Vim)
- install configured plugins (a.k.a. scripts/bundle)
- update configured plugins
- search by name all available Vim scripts
- clean unused plugins up
- run the above actions in a single keypress with interactive mode
