## Accuracy and Precision

In science and engineering, the accuracy of a measurement is the degree of closeness or trueness of that measurement to the true value of the quantity being measured. For example, a ruler that measures a known length of 1 meter as 1 meter would have high accuracy; a ruler that measures the same distance as 0.8 meter would have low accuracy.

The precision of a measurement is the repeatibility of that measurement and expresses the variability within it. For example, if the ruler mentioned above that measured 1 meter as 0.8 meter, measured the distance as 0.80 m, 0.79 m, 0.80 m, 0.81 m and 0.80 m over successive mesurements the ruler would be quite precise (the measurements have low variability), whilst being inaccurate.

The precision of a measurement is independent of the accuracy of the measurement. Likewise the accuracy of a measurement is independent of its precision. This means that measurements can be precise and of low accuracy, accurate and of low precision, precise and accurate, and imprecise and inaccurate.
