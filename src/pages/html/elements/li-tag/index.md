## Li Tag

The `<li>` element is used to represent an individual item within a list. In order to be valid it must be contained within one of the following elements: `<ol>` ordered list, `<ul>` unordered list or a `<menu>` tag.

In both menus and unordered lists the items are displayed with a bullet point whereas in an ordered list each item either displays a number or letter to its left.

Below you can find an example of how a `<li>` would be used in an unordered list.

```html
<ul>
  <li>Hello, world</li>
</ul>
```
