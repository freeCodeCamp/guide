## Area of a Parallelogram

A parallelogram is a 2D shape with four sides. Opposite sides are equal in length and parallel (||). The area of a Parallelogram is defined as the space enclosed by the four sides of the shape.

#### Terminology
Base (b) - The length of the bottom line of the shape. <br>
Height (h) - The distance from the base of the paralellogram to the parallel top line. <br> <i> Note: Height is not the length of one of the sides! It is the length of a line perpendicular to the base line to the top of the parallelogram.</i>

##### Formula

Area of parallelogram =  <span class="texhtml"><span class="texhtml">base</span> *â€‰<i>height</i></span>

##### Example

Given base = 3 cm, height = 5 cm find area of the parallelogram.<br><br>

Area = 3 cm * 5 cm = 15 cm<sup>2</sup>
