## HTML5 Video

With HTML5, you can add videos to your website. The ```<video>``` tag will help you getting this done.

```
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

```
We specify the height and width of the video, and include its source and type of video to be played.
