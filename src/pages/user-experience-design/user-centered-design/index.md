## User Centered Design

User-centered design (UCD) is a framework of steps in which analysis is conducted for the workflow of a product, service or process. Designers examine the usability, characteristics, environment, and tasks of a product and are extensively attentive to all steps of the design process.

The main goal of UCD is to optimize the product, service, or process around how users will use the product, rather than forcing users to confirm or change their behavior to adapt the product.
