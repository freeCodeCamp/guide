Hey Git Noobs. I wrote up some SUPER simple notes on how to get started on GitHub. Using the Mac terminal. 
* the commands to put in to the terminal all start with git.

If you want to make a new project: 

Step 1) Create a new repository 
Step 2) Attached a readme file along with the new project to be created automatically (which you can edit later).
Step 3) Copy the repositroy link
Step 4) git clone [repository link] (don't include the brackets) 
Step 5) git add -A (this will add everything) 
Step 6) git commit -m "message content" 
Step 7) git push
Step 8) git pull 

Note: Escape is wg
