## Behavior Driven Development

Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is a testing practice created to extend Test Driven Development (TDD) by bringing concepts capable of improving test discussions between developers, testers, and domain experts. 

In BDD, tests of any unit of software should be specified in terms of the desired behavior of the unit. In that sense, these tests are usually attached to user stories, requirements set by business determining what value the unit must provide to the client.

Tests usually follow the Given-When-Then rule, where you first start by specifying the initial condition your test is going to run in (Given), the action taken that triggers the event (When), and the results expected by said action (Then).

A simple example in common language could go as follows:

```
Given that a user picked the blue shirt 
When the user presses the button to finish his order
Then the blue shirt must be deducted from the stock
And the money added to the store's bank
```
