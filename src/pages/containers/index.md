## Containers

Containers are an operating-system-level virtualization. It is an operating system feature in which the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances. Such instances, called containers may look like real computers from the point of view of programs running in them. Unlike a program running on an ordinary computer OS, programs that run inside of a container can only access the contents and devices assigned to that container. 

In most cases, containers are used for virtual hosting enviroments (VMs). This allows for the secure allocation of hardware resources between distrusted users. Additionally, admins can utilize containers for hardware consolidation on a single server. Unlike Hypervisors however, containers must share the same kernel.
