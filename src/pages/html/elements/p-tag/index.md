## P Tag

The `<p>` tag stands for paragraph, which is the most common tag used to create lines of words inside the `<html>` document. Using `<p>` will be very useful to add the margin automatically between elements. The `<p>`attribute can also be helpful for CSS styling.

### P tag with other tags
The use of the `<p>` is compatible with other tags, allowing to add hyperlinks (`<a>`), bold (`<strong>`), italics(`<i>`) among others.

### Example
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Paragraph example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      This <strong>sentence</strong> was created to show how the paragraph works.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can also nest an anchor element `<a>` within a paragraph. 

### Example
```html
<p>Here's a 
  <a href="http://freecodecamp.com">link to Free Code Camp.com</a>
  for you to follow.</p>
```
