## Algorithms


An algorithm is like a recipe. It's a series of steps you take in order to achieve a specific outcome.
There are certain requirements that an algorithm must abide by:
<ol>
  <li>Definiteness: Each step in the process is precisely stated</li>
  <li>Effective Computability: Each step in the process can be carried out by a computer.</li>
  <li>Finiteness: The program will eventually successfully terminate.</li>
</ol>

Some common types of algorithms include sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and compression algorithms. Classes of algorithms include Graph, Dynamic Programming, Sorting, Searching, Strings, Math, Computational Geometry, Optimization, Miscellaneous. Although technically not a class of algorithms, Data Structures is often grouped with them. 

### Efficiency

Algorithms are most commonly judged by their efficiency, the amount of computing resources they require to complete their task.

### Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms comes in various flavors depending on your necessity.
Some, very common and widely used are:

#### Quick Sort

There is no sorting discussion which can finish without quick sort. Basic idea is in link below.

freeCodeCamp's curriculum heavily emphasizes creating algorithms. This is because learning algorithms is a good way to practice programming skills. Interviewers most commonly test candidates on algorithms during developer job interviews.
