## Accuracy and Precision

The difference between accuracy and precision.

Precision and accuracy are often used interchangably, however, they are not the same thing.
There is a major difference between them that is commonly overlooked. I find it useful to look at
this visual representation:

As you can see, precision is how gathered your shots are. If you manage to fire all your bullets in one spot,
then your precision is high, even if you miss what you were aiming at by a long way. 

Accuracy is, as you may see, how well you hit what you were aiming at. What you want is of course
high precision and high accuracy.
