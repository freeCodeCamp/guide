## Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

* The Notebook has support for over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and Scala.

* Notebooks can be shared with others using email, Dropbox, GitHub and the Jupyter Notebook Viewer.

* Your code can produce rich, interactive output: HTML, images, videos, LaTeX, and custom MIME types.

### Installing Jupyter Notebook

While Jupyter runs code in many programming languages, Python is a requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the Jupyter Notebook.

Recommendation is to use the Anaconda distribution to install Python and Jupyter. 

#### Installing Jupyter using Anaconda
For new users, it is highly recommended to install Anaconda. Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

Use the following installation steps:

Download Anaconda. We recommend downloading Anaconda’s latest Python 3 version (currently Python 3.5).

Install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded, following the instructions on the download page.

Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook. To run the notebook:

```jupyter notebook```

#### Alternative for Experienced Python users

As an existing Python user, you may wish to install Jupyter using Python’s package manager, pip, instead of Anaconda.

First, ensure that you have the latest pip; older versions may have trouble with some dependencies:

```pip3 install --upgrade pip```

Then install the Jupyter Notebook using:

```pip3 install jupyter```
