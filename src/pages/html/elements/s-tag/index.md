## S Tag


<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
The `<s>` tag renders text with a line through it; a strikethrough. It is used to mark text that is no longer relevant or accurate. It should not be used when deleting things, as `<del>` is used for that. 
#### Example:
`<s>Expensive Text</s> SOLD OUT` <br />
appears as: <br />
<s>Expensive Text</s> SOLD OUT
