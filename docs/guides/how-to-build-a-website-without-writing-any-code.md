It's possible to build dynamic, mobile-responsive websites without writing any code at all, in just a few minutes.

Here are the technologies we used:

*   [atom.io](http://www.atom.io/) a free code editor
*   [startbootstrap.com](http://www.startbootstrap.com/) a collection of free responsive (Bootstrap) templates
*   [powr.io](http://www.powr.io/) a collection of free JavaScript plugins
*   [bitballoon.com](http://www.bitballoon.com/) a tool for drag and drop website deployment

You will quickly reach the limits of what you can do without actually coding, but it's nice to be able to rapidly build working prototype websites like this.
