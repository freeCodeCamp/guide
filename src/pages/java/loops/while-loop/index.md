# While Loop

The `while` loop executes the a group of statements untill an expression evaluates to `true`. For instance:

```java
while (some_condition_is_true)
{
    // do something
}
```

**Note**: For the `while` loop to start executing, you'd require the condition to be true. However, to exit the loop you must do something as given below (otherwise the loop will execute forever. Practically, it will run till the JVM runs out of memory).

## Example
In the following example, the `expression` is given by `iter_While < 10`. As we increment `iter_While` by `1` each time the loop is executed, the `while` loop will keep going till `iter_While` reaches `10`.

```java
int iter_While = 0;
while (iter_While < 10)
{
    System.out.print(iter_While + " ");
    // Increment the counter
    // Iterated 10 times, iter_While 0,1,2...9
    iter_While++;
}
System.out.println("iter_While Value: " + iter_While);
```

Output:
```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
iter_While Value: 10
```
