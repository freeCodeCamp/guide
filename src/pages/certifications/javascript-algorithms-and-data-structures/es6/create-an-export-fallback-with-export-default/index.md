## Create an Export Fallback with export default

What's a fallback value? It's basically a default that the code will go back to if nothing has been set. For example, variables have the default fallback value of `undefined`. That being said, a hint for this challenge!

## Hint 1:

Just add `export default` to the beginning of the function.

## Spoiler Alert - Solution Ahead!

## Solution:

```javascript
"use strict";
export default function subtract(x,y) {return x - y;}
```
