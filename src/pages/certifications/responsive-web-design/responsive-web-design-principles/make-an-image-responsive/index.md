## Make an Image Responsive

Following the instructions:

Add style rules for the img tag to make it responsive to the size of its container. It should display as a block-level element, it should fit the full width of its container without stretching, and it should keep its original aspect ratio.

the style becomes:

```css
<style>
  img {
  max-width: 100%;
  display: block;
  height: auto;
}
</style>
```
