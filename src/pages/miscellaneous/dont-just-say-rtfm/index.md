RTFM comments generally useless

<a href='http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/167765' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>RTFM</a>

**"RTFM"** is **rude**, no doubt about it. However, **links to the manual in comments are perfectly acceptable**, and sometimes the only appropriate response to a question.

So when posting a manual link, be smart. **Drop the RTFM and use nicer wording** so the link survives. Suggestions:

*   Check out the manual page: (link)
*   See the manual: (link)
*   This is explained in the manual: (link)

If the OP was really lazy:

*   Your question is answered in the manual: (link) For future reference, please always remember to look in the manual first. Thanks!
