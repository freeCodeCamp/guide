# Integrated Development Environments

An Integrated Development Environment; often abbreviated as IDE, is a software application designed to help improve a programmer's productivity by providing a suite of tools optimised for a particular language, e.g. syntax highlighter, debugger & compiler, to name a few.

[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/), [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org) & [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/) are all examples of an IDE.
