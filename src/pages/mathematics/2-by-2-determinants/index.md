## 2 by 2 Determinants

The determinant of a 2Ã—2 matrix, is a function mapping the matrix to the difference of products of its diagonals. Therefore, if all the elements of a matrix are real numbers, the determinant of the matrix will be real as well. The following image gives an example of the steps needed to calculate the determinant of a matrix.
