### Example

* If you are measureing a pencil that is 4 inches long and you recieve a measure of 4 inches you obtained an accurate measure.

**Precision** is how close repeated measures are to each other.

### Example

* If you are measuring a pencil that is 4 inches long and you recieve measures of 2, 2.1, and 2 inches you obtained precise measures since they were all within a smale range of one another. However, these measures are not accuaret since the pencil's accutal length is 4 inches.

It is possible for measures to be only accurate or precise, both accurate and precise, or neight accurate nor precise.
