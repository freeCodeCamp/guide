## Adding and Subtracting Radicals and Square Roots
You can add "like" square roots in the same way that you add other kinds of numbers. "Like" square roots are terms that have the same radical parts.

The terms above can be simplified as follows:
 
<img src="https://github.com/codersc/freeCodeCamp-article-images/blob/master/article1img2.png?raw=true" alt="Formula showing 2 times the square root of 3 plus 2 times the square root of 3 equals (2 + 2) times the square root of 3 which equals 4 times the square root of 3">
 
Expressions with unlike radicals can be simplified in some cases. Notice that the principal roots of 100 and 9 are whole numbers. 

<img src="https://github.com/codersc/freeCodeCamp-article-images/blob/master/article1img3.png?raw=true" alt="Formula showing the square root of 100 plus the square root of 9 equals 10 plus 3 which equals 13">

<img src="https://github.com/codersc/freeCodeCamp-article-images/blob/master/article1img4.png?raw=true" alt="Formula showing 4 times the square root of 100 plus 3 times the square root of 9 equals 4 times 10 plus 3 times 3 which equals 49">

Remember that without like terms there is a limit to how much you can simplify.
