## CSS Buttons are fun and easy!

It's very simple to make great looking buttons using pure CSS on your websites.

Assuming you've used the button element in your html, you can simply call it in your stylesheet and give it a variety of different styles.

Among the things you can change are:

* Color
* Size
* Borders
* Button Groups
* Horizontal or Vertical alignment
* Hover effects
And more!

For example, lets say you had a button on your HTML and you wanted to make it #bada55. You could do the following:

```CSS
button {
color: #bada55;
}
```

Now let's say you wanted the button to turn from white to totally #bada55 when your user put the mouse over it.

```CSS
button {
background: white;
}

button:hover {
background: #bada55;
}
```

And that's just a small example of what you can do with just CSS on your buttons.

Have fun!
