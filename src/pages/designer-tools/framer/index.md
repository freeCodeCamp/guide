Framer is meant to be an end-to-end design tool, in which teams can develop, design, and prototype their ideas without having to integrate other tools or input files created in other programs. While the first version offered swift ways to drop in code and create animation and interactivity, you couldnâ€™t use it alone. For example, users would use vector-based programs Sketch or Figma to design the interface, then import those files into Framer to add in interactive elements.
