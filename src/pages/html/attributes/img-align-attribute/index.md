### The align attribute specifies the alignment of an image according to the surrounding element.

### The <img> element is an inline element (it does not insert a new line on a page), meaning that text and other elements can wrap around it. Therefore, it can be useful to specify the alignment of the image according to surrounding elements.

## * Example
### Align an image in the middle of a text:
### ```<p>This is some text. <img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" align="middle"> This is some text.</p>```


## *Syntax
### ```<img align="left|right|middle|top|bottom">```

## *Attribute Values
|Value|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|left|Align the image to the left|
|right|Align the image to the right|
|middle|Align the image in the middle|
|top|Align the image at the top|
|bottom|Align the image at the bottom|
