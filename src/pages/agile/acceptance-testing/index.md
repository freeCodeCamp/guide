## Acceptance Testing

how to contibute project in open source
1. Get To Know Github
GitHub is the most popular platform for open source collaboration, so you'll probably use it when exploring the world of OSS. First, you need to create a GitHub account and read the guide that helps you get started. On GitHub, you can contribute to projects by submitting issues and contributing code. Submitting issues means sending messages about errors in applications and suggesting ways to fix them. Contributing code involves sending pull requests with your corrections and improvements.

2. Learn The Bassic
When working with GitHub, you should know how to use Git â€“ one of the most popular version control tools (also known as revision control tools). Because developers constantly make changes to their code, they need a system that can manage those changes in a central repository. In this way, everyone involved in the development process can download a given piece of software, make changes, and submit updates.

Besides being comfortable with revision control tools, essentials skills include being able to clone a repository and send pull requests. Pull requests inform code maintainers about changes made to the code; they can then review these changes, start a discussion about them, or assign them to a further commit.

3. Join Community
You can easily join an open source project by subscribing to the mailing list for that project. You can find mailing lists on official websites or on GitHub pages. After being accepted to the list, you can communicate with team members and get support if necessary. Thanks to the vibrant communities present in nearly every OSS project, you are likely to get quick replies to your questions.
