title: Markdown Code Formatting
---

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a syntax for composing documents that remain easily human-readable when viewed in plaintext but also can be converted into attractive documents containing the "standard" formatting (_italics_, **bold**, etc.) people expect from word processing software like MS Word, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, etc.

Websites where new programmers often seek guidance from peers and experts (like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), [StackExchange](www.stackexchange.com), [StataList](https://www.statalist.org), and [GitHub](www.github.com), etc.) often support Markdown in their question and answer fields, and the expectation of those communities is usually that the questioner will post _the actual code_ they are trying to run. As a result, people trying to learn programming are well-served by learning basic Markdown formatting.

There are many helpful resources available online, including but not limited to:

+ _Markdown_ by John Gruber on [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
+ _Markdown Here Cheatsheet_ by Adam Pritchard on [GitHub](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet)
+ _Mastering Markdown_, the [GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

The remainder of this document provides guidance on formatting code in Markdown.

# Blocks of code
A _code block_ in Markdown can be initiated by typing three backticks (\`\`\`) and closed by typing three more backticks (\`\`\`). On U.S. QWERTY keyboards, the backtick is often located at the top left of the keyboard, adjacent to the numeral _1_, sharing a key with the tilde (~). (See section below for a visual representation.)

**```js```** ⇦ Type 3 backticks and then press `shift + enter ⏎` (type js or html or css)

```
    <paste your code here>,
    then press [shift + enter ⏎]
```
**```** ⇦ Type 3 backticks, then press `[enter ⏎]`

# Single line code

You can add code snippets in-line without using a code block by surrounding the code with single back-ticks. `print("This is an example of inline code")`.
