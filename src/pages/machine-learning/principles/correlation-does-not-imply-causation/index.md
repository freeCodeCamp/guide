## Correlation Does not Imply Causation

Many Fitness and Health related websites often miss this point about research that tends to happen in these fields. They report the scientific research as Causation other than what it really is, Correlation. For eg. researchers found that early risers have lower BMI and are found to less obese. This correlation can be misrepresented as 'Waking up early can reduce chances of Obesity'. We do not know that just waking up early 'caused' the outcome - lower obesity. What we have found here is Correlation.

Informal definition of Correlation goes as - when event A happens, event B also tends to happen and vice-versa. Or people that wake up early tend to be towards the lower end of the weight spectrum. Both events tend to happen together. But it is not necessary that one event caused the other. 

Causality means that event A 'caused' or lead to the happening of event B. For eg. if I stand in the sun, I would get tanned. Here then second event occurs because of the first.
