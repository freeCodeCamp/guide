## Moodboards

Moodboards (“MBs”) are one of the best ways to start addressing the creative direction of a project. If you take away nothing else from this notion of MBs, its that they’re all about **direction** of creative, not about presenting originally-created work. 

**Who uses Moodboards, and when?**<BR>
Creative designers use MB’s at the beginning of a project, after the creative brief is approved by the client. The creative brief informs the MB’s and all ensuing creative. The MBs are where you, as the designer, begin to visually interpret the creative brief. The overall approach is that you start broad and work towards a focused, selected direction, developing a vernacular with your client, and an understanding of their preferences as they relate to the creative brief. MB’s incorporate and possibly extend existing brand elements (color, typography, photography, etc.) – reference existing style guide, if one exists. MB’s are a great warmup to collaboration with your client.<BR>
*NOTE: It is key that at each phase and for each deliverable, you help your client to understand at what point in the process you are, and what is expected of them from each presentation and with each deliverable. Set their expectations ahead of time so they’re prepared for each engagement. Example, let them know that MB’s are all about working towards a direction and that they will not see any original creative work at this point.*<BR>

**How to Moodboard.**<BR>
*1. Research.*<BR>
Informed by the creative brief and your discussions with stakeholder/client, you will have some idea about several various directions the aesthetics could take. Additional directions may reveal themselves to you as you conduct your visual research. In the early stage, don't worry too much about editing, just source all the most relevant, inspirational, aspirational, pertinent imagery you can. Pull anything/everything that speaks to you, worry about critical editing later. Let the brief and your design-brain guide you. Tools below will help you stay organized. 
  
*2. The MB Philosophy: Single but never alone.*<BR>
The magic of MBs lies not within a single, stand-alone moodboard but that they work as a set, in a compare/contrast mode with each other. That’s how you should think of them and present them. They each represent a distinct direction but because you’ll be presenting at least two and ideally three very different directions, you’ll be able to have a very robust conversation with your client as you talk through each one’s flavor, personality, nuances, and rationale for how each could address the needs/requirements outlined in the discovery documentation (more specifically, the creative and brand requirements doc).<BR> 

*3. The Theme.*<BR>
Each MB contains and conveys a single theme. Every item you choose to include in a board should be a supporting character in that theme.<BR> 

*4. What’s in a Moodboard?*<BR>
Design elements: <BR>
* Color swatches and primary/secondary color schemes 
* Typography – can be type you set with fonts you choose, or found stylized typography and type treatments
* Stylized photography & graphics, icons 
* UI Widgets/components, parts of products or webpages 
* Whitespace + grid – let it breathe. It should look professional and well-crafted, not like a personal scrapbook, unless that’s the aesthetic you want for your specific project 

**Tools & Techniques for Creating Moodboards**<BR>
* Some designers use Pinterest and it’s secret boards feature. This is good for internal group brainstorming (with commenting), not as much for formal client/stakeholder presentation. However, when you’re presenting to a client, you’ll want something more polished, pulled together and professional.
* Another great internal tool is RealTime Board. This is fantastic for collaboration, discussion and organizing a lot of materials. 
* Adobe Illustrator and InDesign are choice for creating (and iterating) the polished presentation boards and deck.

**Motion Boards**<BR>
In case your project includes a lot of dynamic motion, it could be helpful to indicate the types of motion and interaction you're envisioning. Here’s a reference of an animated mood board, or ‘motionboard.’ Thank you, original content creator (will attribute when located).<BR>
