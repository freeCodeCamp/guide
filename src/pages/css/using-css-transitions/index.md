## Using CSS Transitions

The `transition` property is a shorthand property used to represent up to four transition-related longhand properties:
```
.example {
    transition: [transition-property] [transition-duration] [transition-timing-function] [transition-delay];
}
```
These transition properties allow elements to change values over a specified duration, animating the property changes, rather than having them occur immediately.
