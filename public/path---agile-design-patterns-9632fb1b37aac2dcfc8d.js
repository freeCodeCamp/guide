A collection of design patterns for a related field or domain is called a pattern language. Note that there are also patterns at other levels: code, concurrency, architecture, interaction design …</p>\n<p>The book that popularised the field is Gang of Four’s (GoF) <strong>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</strong> (1994). It present a series (23) of patterns for an conventional (C++) OO language classified in three types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Creational</strong> (to create objects): abstract factory, builder, factory method, prototype, singleton.</li>\n<li><strong>Structural</strong> (to compose objects): adapter, bridge, composite, decorator, facade, flyweight, proxy.</li>\n<li><strong>Behavioral</strong> (to communicate between objects): chain of responsibility, command, interpreter, iterator, mediator, memmento, observer, state, strategy, template method, visitor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Patterns can be used for multiple objectives  (learning, communication, improving your tooling) but in agile they should be refactored from code with technical debt and not just added at the start (emergent design/architecture) as initially you don’t have enough knowledge about the (future) system that is going to evolve. Note that what requires a pattern in a language or tool may not be needed or already be part of another language or tool. A framework is a set of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design for a specific type of software and are typically pattern-heavy.</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<!-- Please add any articles you think might be helpful to read before writing the article -->\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">Wikipedia on Design Patterns</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Wikipedia on GoF Book</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns">Design Patterns by Source Making</a>: list of well known patterns available online</li>\n<li><a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/">Game Programming Patterns</a>: book about Design Patterns commonly used in Game Development, available to be read online for free</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.oodesign.com/">Object Oriented Design</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-design-patterns--net-12752">A Beginner’s Guide to Design Patterns</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/10/04/from-design-patterns-to-category-theory/">From design patterns to category theory</a></li>\n</ul>',fields:{slug:"/agile/design-patterns/"},frontmatter:{title:"Design Patterns"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/agile/design-patterns/"}}}});
