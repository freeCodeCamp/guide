## Exiting Vi, Vim, Nvim, Gvim
1. Press escape to get you into "normal" mode
2. Type `:q`, press enter. If you receive an error try `:q!`

**OR**
- Type ZZ (save and quit)
- Close your terminal
- Shut down your computer

## Bare minimum functionality
Most likely you'll find yourself in "normal" mode, it allows you to enter commands by pressing the colon `:` key.
To get here from other modes you can type `ctrl + c` or `escape`.


To edit text and move around in a familiar way press `i`, for "insert" mode.
Try to move around with the arrow keys in "insert" mode.


Depending on the configuration, you may enter a file browser by typing and entering the command `:e .` in "normal" mode. The 'e' stands for edit, and the period for the file or directory.

## I Want to Learn Vim!
For total beginners, Vim comes with a built in tutorial! You can access it by running `vimtutor` from your terminal and this will launch an interactive tutorial on *how to get started with Vim* (takes around 15 minutes to work through).

If you are not as confident in English, you can lanch `vimtutor` in your language of choice. For example `vimtutor fr` will launch the tutorial in french!
