## Application Lifecycle Management

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), while commonly associated with Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is a broader perspective that aligns better with the concept of Product Lifecycle. The development (SDLC) is only a portion of the Application's Lifecycle and therefore is represented as part of the ALM. 

ALM can be divided into three distinct areas: Governance, Development, and Operations:

Governance: Encompasses all of the decision making and project management for this application, extends over the entire existance of the application.

Development: Process (SDLC) of actually creating the application. For most applications, the development process reappears again several more times in the applicationâ€™s lifetime, including bug fixes, improvements and new versions.

Operations: Work required to run and manage the application,typically begins shortly before deployment, then runs continuously until application retirement. Overlaps at times with Development.  

Tools can be used to manage ALM; some of the more popular options include:
