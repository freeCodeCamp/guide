## Dsdm

DSDM is one of the leading Agile approaches, bringing together the agility and flexibility necessary for successful organisations today within a framework of the appropriate level of project governance. The approach is the culmination of two decades of practical experience drawn from a wide range of public and private sector projects.

The DSDM Philosophy is that any project must be aligned to clearly defined strategic goals and focus upon early delivery of real benefits to the business.

DSDM is vendor-independent, covers the entire lifecycle of a project and provides best practice guidance for on-time, in-budget delivery of projects, with proven scalability to address projects of all sizes and for any business sector.

DSDM is designed to be easily tailored and used in conjunction with traditional methods such as PRINCE2Â® or to complement other Agile approaches such as <a href='http://scrummethodology.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Scrum</a>.
