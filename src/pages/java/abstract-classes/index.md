# Abstract Classes
Abstract classes are similar to [interfaces](../pages/java/interfaces/index.md) as they must be implemented by classes, and cannot be instantiated. However, unlike interfaces, abstract classes can define a constructor and have state. For example, an abstract class could be used when all subclasses need to share an object, or a method that uses an object in the abstract class. Interfaces cannot hold objects, but both interfaces and abstract classes can implement methods as of Java 8 ([default methods](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html)).
