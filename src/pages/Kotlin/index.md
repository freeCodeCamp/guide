# Kotlin
Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that
runs on the Java virtual machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code
or use the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Its primary development is from a team of JetBrains programmers
based in Saint Petersburg, Russia.[3] While the syntax is not compatible with Java, Kotlin is 
designed to interoperate with Java code and is reliant on Java code from the existing 
Java Class Library, such as the collections framework.
As of Android Studio 3.0 (Beta version) Kotlin is a fully supported programming language
on Android and lets the user choose between targeting Java 6 or Java 8 compatible bytecode.
