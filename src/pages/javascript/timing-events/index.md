Timing events in JavaScript are scripted events that happen in set timed intervals. 
The two primary methods are:
```
setTimeout(function, milliseconds) // Executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.
setInterval(function, milliseconds) // Repeats the execution of the function continuously in intervals of a set time.
```
