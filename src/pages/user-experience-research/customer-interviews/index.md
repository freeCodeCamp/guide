## Customer Interviews

Building personas sometimes involve research. This research can be in the form of customer interviews. This is a one-on-one interaction with existing or potential users. It is used to gain qualitative information about users of your product. 

It is usually conducted by two persons: one does the questioning while the other person takes notes. Questions are usually centered around:

* Background.
* Demographics.
* Identifiers.
* Goals.
* Challenges. 
* Possible solutions.
