## User Acceptance Tests

When do all the parties, all the departments or all the users officially test the product and accept or refuse it? Before we try to answer that question, a quick reminder of what User Acceptance Testing actually is.

According to the leading international testing organization ISTQB , User Acceptance Testing is:

## “Formal testing with respect to user needs, requirements, and business processes conducted to determine whether or not a system satisfies the acceptance criteria and to enable the user, customers or other authorized entity to determine whether or not to accept the system” Source: www.istqb.org
