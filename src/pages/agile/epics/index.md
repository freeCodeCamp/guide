## Epics

In the agile backlog, an Epic is a really large story. It is not groomed. It is probably bigger than a single iteration. The Epic can be considered a placeholder, adding something large to a future iteration or release, but not spending much energy on it since the details will change before you can get to it.

By keeping your backlog in priority order, as you see an Epic moving up in the list, that's your cue to groom and possibly split it into smaller, manageable stories.
