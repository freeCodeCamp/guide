What is Docker?

Docker is incredibly popular because it makes it possible to get far more apps running on same old servers while at the same time it also makes it very easy to package and ship programs. 

Many businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained by existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing and increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application architectures.

Docker, is an open-source technology embraced by some of the most succesful companies in the world.

What are the benefits of Docker?

Firstly Docker containers are pretty easy to deploy in a cloud. Docker brings several new things to the table that the earlier technologies didn't. The first is that it's made containers easier and safer to deploy and use than previous approaches. In addition, because Docker's partnering with the other container powers, including Canonical, Google, Red Hat, and Parallels, on its key open-source component libcontainer, it's brought much-needed standardization to containers.

Docker can get more applications running on the same hardware than other technologies; it makes it easy for developers to quickly create ready-to-run containered applications; and it makes managing and deploying applications much easier.
