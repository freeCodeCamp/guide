## Use body-parser to Parse POST Requests

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
The body-parser should already be added to your project if you used the provided boilerplate, but if not it should be there as:

```code
"dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.4.3",
    ...
```

You need to do for this challenge is pass the middleware to app.use(). Make sure it comes before the paths it needs to be used on.
