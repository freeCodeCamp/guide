## Bare minimum functionality
Most likely you'll find yourself in "normal" mode, it allows you to enter commands by pressing the colon `:` key.
To get here from other modes you can type `ctrl + c` or `escape`.


To edit text and move around in a familiar way press `i`, for "insert" mode.
Try to move around with the arrow keys in "insert" mode.


Depending on the configuration, you may enter a file browser by typing and entering the command `:e .` in "normal" mode. The 'e' stands for edit, and the period for the file or directory.
