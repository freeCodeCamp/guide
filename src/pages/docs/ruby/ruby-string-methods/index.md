Ruby has many built in methods to work with strings. Strings in Ruby by default are mutable and can be changed in place or a new string can be returned from a method.

## Length:

*   The `.length` property returns the number of characters in a string including white-space.

    "Hello".length
    # returns: 5

    "Hello World!".length
    # returns: 12

## Count:

*   The `.count` method counts how many times a specific character(s) is found in a string.
*   This method is case-sensitive.

    "HELLO".count('L')  
    # returns: 2

    "HELLO WORLD!".count('LO')  
    # returns: 1

## Insert:

*   The `.insert` method inserts a string into another string before a given index.

    "Hello".insert(3, "hi5")
    # returns:
    Helhi5lo
    # "hi5" is inserted into the string right before the second 'l' which is at index 3

## Upcase:

*   The `.upcase` method transforms all letters in a string to uppercase.

    "Hello".upcase
    # returns:
    HELLO

## Downcase:

*   The `.downcase` method transforms all letters in a string to lowercase.

    "Hello".downcase
    # returns:
    hello

## Capitilize:

*   The `.capitalize` method make the first letter in a string uppercase and the rest of the string lowercase.

    "HELLO".capitalize
    # returns:
    Hello

    "HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?".capitalize
    # returns:
    Hello, how are you?

_Note that the first letter is only capitilized if it is at the beginning of the string._

    "-HELLO".capitalize
    "1HELLO".capitalize
    # returns:
    -hello
    1hello

## Reverse:

*   The `.reverse` method reverses the order of the characters in a string.

    "Hello World!".reverse
    # returns:
    "!dlroW olleH"

## Split:

*   The `.split` takes a strings and _splits_ it into an array, then returns the array.
*   The default method splits the string based on whitespace, unless a different separator is provided (see second example).

    "Hello, how are you?".split
    # returns:
    ["Hello,", "how", "are", "you?"]

    "H-e-l-l-o".split('-')
    # returns:
    ["H", "e", "l", "l", "o"]

## Chop:

*   The `.chop` method removes the last character of the string.
*   A new string is returned, unless you use the `.chop!` method which mutates the original string.

    "Name".chop
    # returns:
    Nam

    name = "Batman"
    name.chop
    name == "Batma" # returns false

    name = "Batman"
    name.chop!
    name == "Batma" # returns true

## Strip:

*   The `.strip` method removes the leading and trailing whitespace on strings, including tabs, newlines, and carriage returns (`\t`, `\n`, `\r`).

    "  Hello  ".strip
    # returns:
    Hello

## Chomp:

*   The `.chomp` method removes the last character in a string, only if itâ€™s a carriage return or newline (`\r`, `\n`).
*   This method is commonly used with the `gets` command to remove returns from user input.

    "hello\r".chomp
    # returns:
    hello

    "hello\t".chomp
    # returns:
    hello\t #because tabs and other whitespace remain intact when using `chomp`

## To Integer:

*   The `.to_i` method converts a string to an integer.

    "15".to_i
    # returns:
    15 #integer
