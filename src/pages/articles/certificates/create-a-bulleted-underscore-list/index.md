title: Create a Bulleted Underscore List
---
HTML has a special element for creating unordered lists, or bullet point-style lists.

Unordered lists start with a `<ul>` element. Then they contain some number of `<li>` elements.

For example:

    <ul>
      <li>milk</li>
      <li>cheese</li>
    </ul>

would create a bullet point-style list of "milk" and "cheese".
