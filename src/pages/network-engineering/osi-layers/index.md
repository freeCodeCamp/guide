## The OSI Layers

### Introduction

Have you ever wondered how data is sent through the network from one machine to another? If yes, then the Open System Interconnected model is what you are looking for. 

The OSI model is used to help standardise and characterise how data should flow from sender to receiver without the taking into consideration the underlying internal structure of the endpoint (sender, receiver).

The organisation that came up with this model is the **International Standardisation Organisation** and hence this model is formally referred to as **ISO - OSI**.


### Architecture 

As in the figure below the model divides the network into **7 layers**. Data communication in the OSI model starts with the top layer ( Application Layer ) of the stack at the sending side, travels down the stack to the sender's lowest layer ( Physical Layer ), then traverses the physical network connection to the bottom layer on the receiving side, and up its OSI model stack. 

We go for a layered approach because it is easy to design independent layers with dedicated functions which interact with each other as compared to a single complex model.
