## Imaginary Numbers

An Imaginary Number "i" is defined simply as the square root of -1. In other words i<sup>2</sup> = -1. One of the reasons you would use Imaginary Numbers (or Complex Numbers as some others call them) is so that you can manipulate equations or expressions that contain the square root of -1.
