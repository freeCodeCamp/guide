## XAML

Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) was created by Microsoft and is an XML-based markup language.<sup>1</sup> (Markup languages are designed for the processing, definition and presentation of text). XAML is the language used for a Microsoft-based interface design design tool called Microsoft Blend for Visual Studio, formerly known as Microsoft Expression Blend, which is used in creating graphical interfaces for web and desktop applications. 

The benefit of using XAML over other GUI programs, such as WinForms, is that it is not coded in the same language that is used in interacting with the GUI. Because of this, writing and editing your GUI becomes a lot easier, much like it is with HTML. XAML is also much shorter to write than other coding languages, such as C#.<sup>2</sup> 

The syntax used for XAML is rather simple. The syntax for a button is simply:
  ```ruby
  <button>
  ```
  
To end the tag, you can type it two different ways, both involving a backslash<sup>3</sup>:
```ruby
<button /> or </button>
```
