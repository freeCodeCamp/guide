title: Singleton
---

The singleton is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. It is useful when you want to give only one object the ability to coordinate actions across your application.

## Singleton in Android
Singleton is a design pattern often used in Android. It is easily misused and so can cause app to be hard to maintain. It is useful in Android beause they live across fragments, activities, and rotations. 

- Singletons are often used in Android to store temporary data
- They allow the application to have one owner of the data and provides an easy way to pass data between controller classes
- Singletons are destroyed when Android removes your app from memory
- Singletons can make it difficult to unit test your app

```
public class DataStore {
  private static DataStore sDataStore;
  private List<Data> mData;
  
  public static DataStore get(Context context) {
    if (sDataStore == null) {
      sDataStore = new DataStore(context);
    }
    return sDataStore;
  }
  
  // Make constructor private to prevent other classes from creating a DataStore instance
  private DataStore(Context context) {
    mData = new ArrayList<>();
  }
  
  // The only way for other classes to get data from DataStore
  public List<Data> getData() {
    return mData;
  }
}
```
