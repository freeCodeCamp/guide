## Imposter Syndrome

A feeling of _being a fraud_ or _not good enough_ to get the job done. Common among software engineers, developers and designers working in tech companies. People suffering from imposter syndrome have a sense of inadequacy and insecurity concerning their ability to make a contribution at the workplace. In reality, they maybe perfectly capable of and do contribute successfully to their tasks.

These thoughts are fairly common if you suffer from imposter syndrome:

* "What am I doing here?"
* "I am not a developer. I am fooling myself and other people"
* "My colleagues are much smarter than me and I dont think I could ever match up to them"
* "I have no idea how I got through the interview process"
* "People are going to realise that I am not as smart as I potrayed in the interview and I will be ridiculed and fired for this"
* "My IQ is not high enough to work here"
