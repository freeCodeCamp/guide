## Collocation Vs Distributed
- Co-located refers to a team that sits together; same office. Ideally, everyone sitting together in adjacent offices or an open workspace.
- Distributed team members are scattered geographically; different buildings, cities, or even countries.
In case of distributed team, infrastructure should facilitate processes in order to resolve time difference and distance between team members, thus providing an efficient way of working altogether.
