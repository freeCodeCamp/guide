## Robotics

Robotics is about the systems that make up robots.These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions.

### Overview
The concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century.[1] Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily.

There are a multitude of varieties of robot types and component systems.
Each robot usually is dedicated to a set of processes with clear objectives.
A robot consists of "tools" that it uses to accomplish processes, and some kind of control system to manipulate the tools.
