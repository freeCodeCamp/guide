## Area of a Ellipse

The area of an ellipse is the space enclosed by the perimeter of the ellipse.

#### Terminology

Pi (<span class="texhtml">π</span>) - A mathematical constant which is approximated as 3.14

The Major Axis (A) - The longest diameter of the ellipse. It touches both ends of the ellipse, passes through the center, and is the longest possible straight line you can draw inside of an ellipse.

The Minor Axis (B) - The shortest diameter of the ellipse. This line also touches both ends of the ellipse and passes through the center.

#### Formula

Area of an ellipse = <span class="texhtml">π</span> * A * B

#### Examples

1. Given that the minor axis is 4ft and the major axis is 5ft, find the area of the ellipse.
  
    Area of ellipse = <span class="texhtml">π</span> * A * B
    
      <span class="texhtml">π</span> = 3.14
      A = 5ft
      B = 4ft
      
    Area of ellipse = <span class="texhtml">π</span> * 5ft * 4ft
    Area of ellipse =  62.8ft
    
2. Given that the minor axis is 2cm and the area of the ellipse is 188.4cm, find the length of the major axis in cm.
  
    Area of ellipse = <span class="texhtml">π</span> * A * B
    
      Area of ellipse = 188.4cm
      <span class="texhtml">π</span> = 3.14
      B = 2cm
      
    188.4cm = <span class="texhtml">π</span> * A * 2cm
    A = 30cm
