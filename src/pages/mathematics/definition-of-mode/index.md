## Definition of Mode

The mode (also known as the modal value) is the number which appears most frequently within a set of numbers.

![An example of a mode tally, here 20 is the mode as it occurs most frequently](https://github.com/tribalizzles/FreeCodeCamp-projects/blob/master/Mode1.png?raw=true "Mode")

In the above example, 20 is the mode as it is observed more often than any of the other numbers.


A data set can contain multiple modes if more than one value appears at the greatest frequency. 
* If this occurs with two numbers the data set is bimodal.
* If there are more than two modal values, the data set is multimodal.
* If there is no value that occurs more frequently, then the data set has no mode.
