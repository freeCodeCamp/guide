## Volume of a Sphere

A sphere is a perfectly round three-dimensional geometrical object. It can be defined as a set of points that are all at the same distance from a point in a three-dimensional space.

It's radius can be defined as the distance between any point in it's surface and it's center.

```
Being radius = r

Volume = 4/3 * π * r
```

### Example

If you have a sphere with radius = 10 cm

```
Volume = 4/3 * π * r
       ≅ 4/3 * 3.14 * 10
       ≅ 41.86 cm²
```
