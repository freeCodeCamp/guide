# nameof Expressions

Sometimes you need the string name of a variable, type, or member for things such as raising an exception, logging, or firing property changed events. Prior to C# 6.0, you might use a string literal for such purposes.
##
```
public void ProcessStudent(Student student)
{
    if (student == null) throw new ArgumentNullException("student");
}
```
However, if the student parameter were to be renamed, you would have to remember to also modify the string literal. Now with nameof expressions, you donâ€™t have to use string literals and the compiler will be able to warn you if you are using an incorrect name.
##
```
public void ProcessStudent(Student student)
{
    if (student == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(student));
}
```
Some examples of where nameof expressions may be useful include:
* Throwing exceptions during parameter validation
* Passing an action name when setting up MVC action links
* Needing to pass the name of a property when firing a property changed event in a class that implements INotifyPropertyChanged
* Passing the name of a property when registering a XAML dependency property
* Including a variable, type, or member name when logging

It should be noted that if you provide nameof with a qualified name, the compiler will generate a string for the rightmost name.
