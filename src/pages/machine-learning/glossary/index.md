## Glossary

A quick one or two sentences describing common terms. See individual pages for
more details.

- **Machine Learning** - Intersection of statistics and computer science in
  order to teach computers to perform tasks without explicitly being programmed.
  - **Deep Learning** - An umbrella term for machine learning methods based on learning data representations as opposed to algorithms based on fulfilling a given task. It includes architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks.
  - **Neuroevolution** - An umbrella term for machine learning methods based on generating neural networks through weight, bias, and architecture through random mutations of the network. The most common forms of neuroevolution are Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies([NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies)) and Interactively Constrained Neuro-Evolution ([ICONE](http://ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/~neurokybernetik/media/pdf/2012-1.pdf)). 
- **Statistical Learning** - the use of machine learning with the goal of
  statistical inference, whereby you make conclusions of the data rather than
  focus on prediction accuracy
- **Supervised Learning** - Using historical data to predict the future. Example: Using historical data of prices at which houses were sold to predict the price in which your house will be sold. Regression and Classification come under supervised learning.
- **Unsupervised Learning** - Finding patterns in unlabelled data. Example: Grouping customers by purchasing behaviour. Clustering comes under unsupervised learning.
- **Reinforcement learning** - Using a simulated or real environment in which a machine learning algorithm is given input and sparse rewards to build a model to predict actions. Reinforcement learning has been used [to train virtual robots to balance themselves](https://blog.openai.com/competitive-self-play/) and [to beat games designed for humans](https://blog.openai.com/openai-baselines-dqn/).
- **Regression** - A machine learning technique used to predict continous values. Linear Regression is one of the most popular regression algorithm.  
- **Classification** - A machine learning technique used to predict discrete values. Logistic Regression is one of the most popular classification algorithm.
- **Association Rule learning** - A rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. 
```
f: x -> y  

Here 'f' is a function that takes 'x' as input and produces 'y' as output.

If the output value 'y' is a real number / continous value then the function 
is a regression technique.  

If the output value 'y' is a discrete / categorical value then the function is a classification technique.
```  
- **Clustering** - Grouping of unlabelled data. Identifying patterns using statistics.
- **Dimensionality Reduction** - Reducing the number of random variables in the data to get more accurate predictions.
