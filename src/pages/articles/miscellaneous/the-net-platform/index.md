title: the Net Platform
---
**.NET platform** is a big and comprehensive collection of frameworks and libraries managed by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/net). C# is the most popular language used to develop a range of .NET applications, such as [web apps](http://www.asp.net/), [windows aps](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/), [Mac and iPhone apps](https://www.xamarin.com/platform).

We will start with learning <a>C# programing language</a>, and will make you familiar with development environment, project structures, techniques, and best practices that you will perform as a professional developer.

First let's begin with a brief overview of the .NET platform, and get some jargons out of the way. Don't worry, you don't have to know in-depth about these at this point.

*   [.NET Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/w0x726c2(v=vs.110).aspx) : (_pronounced dot net_) provides configuration for your application to run on top of it. It provides all the services an app needs; for instance communication with database, networks, file systems which are commonly used to build console, desktop, web, mobile and game applications.
    *   [CLR (Common Language Runtime)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8bs2ecf4(v=vs.100).aspx) : is an execution environment for your application which manages its life-cycle. CLR provides services like memory management, and is:

    1\. implementation of [CLI standard(Common Language Infrastructure)](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm)
    2\. designed to be platform-independent. Platform refers to the computer architecture and operating system.
    3\. language independent, for instance can be used for C#, C++,[VB.NET][vbnet] and [F#][fsharp].

*   C-Sharp Compiler : a `csc.exe` is a compiler which transforms C# code into Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL), commonly referred as IL. It defines instructions which CLR can understand. CLR's job is to read these instructions and tranform them into machine-understandable instructions.

*   Class libraries : It contains thousands of in-built classes for your application's use, for example [`System.IO`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io(v=vs.110).aspx) for reading/writing data streams, [`HttpClient`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.http.httpclient(v=vs.118).aspx) sends data over network, [`ASP.NET`](http://www.asp.net/) for web applications, [`ADO.NET`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h43ks021(v=vs.110).aspx)for data access to relational databases (like Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL), and [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms735119(v=vs.90).aspx) for service-oriented applications which communicates over established protocols like HTTP, REST, SOAP and TCP etc.

*   The C# Programming Language (_pronounced "C-sharp"_) : C# has a syntax similar to Java, C++, and Javascript. It is:

    1.  used to write applications, services and reusable libraries.
    2.  designed to work with .NET platform.
    3.  strongly typed, high level object oriented language.
    *   [.NET Core](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2014/12/04/introducing-net-core/) : is Microsoft's recent endeavour to move towards open source, cross platform development delivered as [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/) packages. They are working with [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) community, which is an implementation of Microsoft .NET framework to build apps on Windows, Linux, and iOS.

    *   [Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/) : primarily intended to focus on web browsers plug-in to provide enrich multimedia.

    *   [.NET for windows app](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/) : used to create Windows 8.x Store apps using C#.
