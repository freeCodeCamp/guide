## Personas

<h2>What is a persona?</h2>
Personas are fictionalized representations of an archetypal user. User research data is synthesized and studied with key elements extracted to build personas. They tell a story about real needs, goals and limitations. 

Core elements of a persona usually include:
<ul><li>Photograph - A real person, not a drawing or cartoon. This helps to see the user as a real person</li>
  <li>Demographc Information - Fictionalized age, job, skills, etc.</li>
  <li>Biography - Brief description of the user's background, interests and life in the context of the project</li>
  <li>Goals - What the user wants and needs</li>
  <li>Challenges - What is stopping the user, or at least holding them back, from getting what they want</li></ul>

<h2>Why are personas important?</h2>
Personas help the designer stay on track. When a designer hits a stumbling block within the project, rather than guessing, he or she can reference the persona and ask themselves what the user would do or want. This helps create empathy between the designer and the user. Personas also communicate research findings to the rest of the team. Not every team member can be present at all stages of UX research design, but the persona can help succinctly convey important information.
