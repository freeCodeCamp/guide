## User Acceptance Tests

One of the final steps in software testing is user acceptance testing (UAT). UAT makes sure actual users can use the software. Also referred to as beta, application, and end-user testing. 

UAT checks that everything works properly and that there are no crashes. Those of the intended audience should complete the testing; this could be comprised of many people involved from the process and anyone who is able to test before going live.
