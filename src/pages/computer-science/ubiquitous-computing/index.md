## Ubiquitous Computing
The term ubiquitous computing was introduced by Mark Weiser in 1988. He wrote several papers in which he describes his vision of a future where technology is embedded in the environment and everyday objects.

One of the main ideas of ubiquitous computing is that those embedded devices communicate with each other and the surrounding environment in an invisible way so that they can support us in our daily life without being noticed.

Ubiquitous computing is often referred to as pervasive or calm computing because it is about everything in the world being embedded with sensors so that the environment around us can configure itself to all of our needs and requirements without requiring any input or confirmation from us.

A famous example of ubiquitous technology is a smart fridge that knows when you are running low on milk. It would contact your local supermarket so that milk is added to the next delivery of groceries. A smart fridge could also provide you with recipe ideas based on the ingredients that are inside it.
