## Unconscious Bias

<p>Unconscious biases, otherwise known as implicit bias, are social stereotypes about certain groups of people that individuals form outside their conscious awareness. Everyone holds unconscious beliefs about various social and identity groups, and these biases stem from one’s tendency to organize social worlds by categorizing.</p>

<blockquote> Bias is a prejudice in favor of, or against, one thing, person, or group. Generally this involves negative comparison with another person, thing, or group. Biases may be held by an individual, group, or institution and can have negative or positive consequences.

<p>Unconscious bias occurs when people favour others who look like them and/or share their values. For example a person may be drawn to someone with a similar educational background, from the same area, or who is the same race or ethnicity as them.</p>

<p>Implicit or unconscious bias happens when our brains make incredibly quick judgments and assessments of people and situations without us realising. Our biases are influenced by our background, cultural environment and personal experiences. We may not even be aware of these views and opinions, or be aware of their full impact and implications.</p>

<p>Unconscious bias is far more prevalent than conscious prejudice and often incompatible with one’s conscious values. Certain scenarios can activate unconscious attitudes and beliefs. For example, biases may be more prevalent when multi-tasking or working under time pressure.</p> 
<p>Unconscious bias can influence decisions in recruitment, promotion and performance management. It could be discriminatory when the unconscious bias relates to a protected characteristic.</p>
