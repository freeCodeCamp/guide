## Center Tag

Center tag aligns the text in center. Usage is simple:

```html
<center>I will be a center-aligned text</center>
```

But we shouldn't think that it would center all elements. Various situations require different approach. For example, HTML5 doesn't support center tag and therefore you would need to do it with CSS.
