## Imposter Syndrome

A feeling of _being a fraud_ or _not good enough_ to get the job done. Common among software engineers, developers and designers working in tech companies. People suffering from imposter syndrome have a sense of inadequacy and insecurity concerning their ability to make a contribution at the workplace. In reality, they may be perfectly capable of and do contribute successfully to their tasks.

Imposter Syndrome is very common among software engineers or developers who are new to the role and lack the experience of some of their co-workers. Throughout various industries, imposter syndrome is very common with highly successful people. Studies have found the two out of five 'successful' people consider themselves frauds/imposters while other studies have shown that up to 70% of people experience imposter syndrome as one point in time or another.

These thoughts are fairly common if you suffer from imposter syndrome:


* "What am I doing here?" 
* "I am not a developer. I am fooling myself and other people" (feels fake)
* "My colleagues are much smarter than me and I don't think I could ever match up to them" (undermines own achievements)
* "My coworkers have told me I've achieved a lot, but I feel like it's never enough" (discounts praise)
* "I have no idea how I got through the interview process" (feels only luck dictates results)
* "People are going to realise that I am not as smart as I potrayed in the interview and I will be ridiculed and fired for this" (fears failure)
* "My IQ is not high enough to work here"
