## Python Object Oriented Programming

Python is a multi-paradigm programming language supporting different programming approaches. One excellent programming paradigm is Object-oriented Programming, or OOP for short, by creating objects.

In OOP properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects, characterized by:
- attributes
- behaviors

For instance, an object could represent a person with attributes as name, age, address, with behaviors like walking, talking, breathing, and running.

OOP models real-world entities as software objects, which have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions. Objects are modeled as **classes**, that are a sort of *blueprint*.
