## Area of a Triangle

A triangle is half as big as the rectangle that surrounds it, which is why the area of a triangle is one-half base times height.

therefore the area of triangle is defined by 1/2(base * height)

if the sides of the triangle is known:

consider the sides are a,b,c

then to find the area of triangle there are 2 steps to be followed:

step1:
 find the half the perimeter of triangle ie. s = (a+b+c)/2
 
 step2:
 apply the heron's formula = sqrt(s((s-a) * (s-b) * (s-c))
 
 note:
 the sqrt() function is a function in mathematics for finding the squareroot of a number
