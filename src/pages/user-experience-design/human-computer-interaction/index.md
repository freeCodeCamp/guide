## Human Computer Interaction

## What is Human Computer Interaction.

Human Computer Interaction, also known as HCI is a discipline in the computer science that deals with the research and study of how humans interact with computer interface. Initially, the HCI was a research discipline that was concerned with coginitive science and human factor engineering, but in recent times, HCI has been widely adopted and embraced as a research discipline for the human centered system design that involves software design, website design, app design and many other design elements such as interactive designs.

## The need and evolution of Human Computer Interaction

Until late 1970s, technology professionals such as software engineers and IT professionals were the only people who interacted with and used computers in everyday lives and thus computers were designed and built with not so user friendly design because technical people were still able to use it significantly (using commands to interact with elements on the computer screen). 

However, as technology became more widespread and user-friendly, it was a challenge for manufacturers to design and build user friendly computers that general (non-technical) people can use easily and hereâ€™s where Human Computer Interaction came into wide adoption.

With recent shift to smaller and smarter devices, the HCI has become even more vital for designers in order to design and cater a truly human-touch User Experience (UX) to the users.
