<p>
Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when there is a need for binary( in 0 or 1)  categorization of data.<br>
Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.

<H3>APPLICATION OF LOGISTIC REGRESSION</H3>
  <UL>
    <li> To categorize e-mails as Spam or Not Spam
    <li> To find whether a patient has a certain disease or not
    <li> To predict survival in case of disasters etc.

Now as we can clearly see in the graph that logistic regression curve passes through more data points and thus, has less noise(error scope) and is a better predictor.<br>
The graph has data points on x-axis and probability which is binary in this case on y-axis.<br>
Now if you watch closely linear regression line actually goes below 0 for some values which does not make any sense and thus for binary classifications we use logistic regression.
