## Technical Debt
Technical debt (also known as design debt or code debt) is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.

With agile development, you are often producing software that is "good enough". So, you will also be adding to your technical debt. This is the accumulation of short cuts and work-arounds.

Compare it to money. When you charge something on a credit card, you've made a commitment to pay it back later. When you create technical debt, your team *should* commit to addressing those issues at a later time.

### The good and the bad

> Technical debt is bad, but more often than not optimal.

Users don’t care what your code looks like. They just want your product. A single perfect feature that was never released and failed is worth nothing compared to a scrappy product that has a handful of features that users gravitate towards. You can then iterate on the features that gain traction and refine them to gain more traction and scale. Once your product matures, you should pay back the technical debt. This will position your product for future success.

The return from the technical debt must be higher than the debt itself. That is, whatever it is that you’re able to achieve by acquiring the debt, it must have a greater impact than the debt itself.

Technical debt is not an excuse to be lazy. It should be **used tactically with a long-term vision in mind**. Later on, when it makes sense, you should pay back your technical debt. Contrary to popular belief, **acquiring technical debt may actually be the optimal decision** in many instances.
