JSON syntax is a subset of Javascript syntax.

- Data is represented in name/value pairs.
- Each object name is followed by a colon ':'.
- Each value/name pairs are separated by comma ','.
- Curly braces {} are used to hold objects.
- Square braces [] are used to hold Arrays.

Here is an example:

```
{
  "movie": [
  
    {
        "name": "Westworld",
        "release": "2016",
        "genre": "sci-fi",
        "director": "Jonathan Nolan"
     },
     
     {
        "name": "The Martian",
        "release": "2015",
        "genre": "sci-fi",
        "director": "Ridley Scott"
      }
      
    ]
    
 }
 
 ```    
 
 JSON supports the following data strucures:
 
 * Collection of name/value pairs.
 * Ordered list: Arrays, List, Vectors, Sequence etc.
