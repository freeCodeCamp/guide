A mood board is a collage-like presentation tool used to convey a style or idea.  They may be digital, or on foamcore or cardboard.  Many types of designers create mood boards, including graphic designers, industrial designers, and User Experience/User Interface designers.  A designer may make a mood board as part of the initial exploratory stages of a design project.

Mood boards can convey color scheme, type face, and specific imagery.  They can also explore tone and mood more abstractly.  A board can include video or sound in addition to static images, photography, and text.

Mood Boards are a great way for people to assess their emotions and personality. It is a way for them to share their style, direction, brand, or project. Creating a mood board allows collaboration from not only the audience, but from the interface designers as well. By having a mood board on hand, designers are able to base a website off the colors and images chosen for the board. 

Ultimately, the main goal of a mood board is to inspire passion and create an emotional experience for the user. You can combine colors of different palettes, galleries, and unique fonts in order to demonstrate the feeling you want to share with those who lay eyes on the board.
