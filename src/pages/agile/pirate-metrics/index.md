## Pirate Metrics

Dave McClure identified five high-level metric categories critical to a startup’s success: 
Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral. 

He coined the term “Pirate Metrics” from the acronym for these five metric categories (AARRR).

In their book Lean Analytics, Croll and Yoskovitz interpret these metrics visually as a funnel:

And with more pointed explanations as a table:
