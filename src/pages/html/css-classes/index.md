## CSS Classes

Classes are an efficient way of grouping HTML elements so that they can share the same styles.

---

When you're writing HTML you can add a class to an element like so: 

```html

<h1 class="superMan">"Here I come to save the day!"</h1>

<p> is a popular catchphrase that <span class="superMan">Super Man </span>often said.</p>

```

Then  in our CSS file we should add the special attributes to the class.  
```css
.superMan {
color: red;
background-color: blue;
}

```
 

Notice that classes have the prefix of a period (.) in CSS.
