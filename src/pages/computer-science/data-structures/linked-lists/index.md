<h2>Linked Lists</h2>
<hr>
<blockquote>Linked lists are simple linear data structure which helps in storing dynamic data. Each list consists of data and a pointer to a node. There are 3 different types of linked lists as listed below: </blockquote>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Singly Linked List:</strong><p>In this type, the first node is called as a <i>head</i> of the list and last element as <i>tail.</i>Each data element has a link or a pointer to the next node in the list. The last element points to null.Hence, this can traverse only in the forward direction.Below is the picture.</p>

  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Doubly Linked List:</strong><p>It eliminates many of the difficulties of singly linked list. In this, each element has a link or pointer to the previous node as well as to the next element in the list. This helps in traversing in both direction i.e. forward and backward.
  Below is the picture.</p>

  <li><strong>Circular Linked List:</strong><p>This linked list type doesn't have head or tail. The tail points to the head. 
  Each element in the list has non-null next pointers. Below is the picture.</p>
