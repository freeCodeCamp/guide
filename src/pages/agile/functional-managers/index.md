## Functional Managers

Functional manager is a person that have management authority over group of people. That authority comes from the formal position of that person in the organization (eg. director of the department, quality department manager, development team manager). Role of functional managers is different then Project Managers or ScrumMasters and is not project based.  
In more Agile organizations exists different models. Functional manager often are responsible for developing people in their groups, securing budgets and time for people. 
However there are also some Agile company models where functions usually assigned to functional managers are distributed to other roles within organization (eg. Spotify model with Tribes, Guilds, Chapters, Squads).
