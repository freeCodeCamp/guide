## Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration is a software development technique in which developers will integrate their code into a shared repository frequently. After every check in a quality check will be executed on the code. This helps in determining any problems early.

Continuous Integration should be followed by automated builds which also execute integrations tests. In case any integrations tests fail, the new changes can be rolled back.

Some of the important points about Continuous Integration

   - Integrate frquently
   
   - Automate the build
   
   - Build should be fast
   
   - Monitor the builds
