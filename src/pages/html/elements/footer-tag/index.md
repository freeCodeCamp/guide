## Footer Tag

The footer tag is vital to every single website. It serves many purposes and should never not be included in your code when creating a new site. The footer tag starts with a typical tag, `<footer>footer content</footer>`. It can have classes applied to it like most other elements, for example: `<footer class="site-footer">footer content</footer>`.

The footer element is typically used to house a lot of information and other elements that are going to be used throughout the entire site. Based on the way you set up your project, it is primarily used to house many script tags that need to be rendered after the page loads, typically some contact information, or anything that needs to be repeated on every page. 

If you are using PHP for your website, you could create a reusable footer that can be included on every page with a simple line: `<?php include 'inc/footer.php'; ?>`. This assumes that you have created an inc directory in your project to contain all of your files to be included in multiple places. Using this syntax, it is easy to create your footer once and reuse it all throughout your site.
