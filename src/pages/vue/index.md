## VueJS

Vue is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. It's easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. Vue is perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

### Installation

The easiest way to get started with Vue is including the script tag directly in your page:

`<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>`

If you want to install Vue locally to make use of more sophisticated options such as Hot Module Replacement to recommended way is using *NPM*:

* $ `npm install vue`

There's also a more user friendly way of installing Vue locally which is using the vue-cli:

* $ `npm install -g @vue/cli`
* $ `vue create hello-world`
