## Bootstrap Glyphicon Components

Bootstrap 3 includes 260 glyphicons. Glyphicons are normally not free of charge, but their creator has made them available for Bootstrap free of cost. As a thank you, you should include a link back to Glyphicons whenever possible.

Use glyphicons in text, navigation, buttons, forms, or toolbars.

## Examples

```html
<p>Star icon: <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></p>
<p>Refresh icon: <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh"></span></p>
<p>Envelope icon: <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></span></p> 
```

## Note
Bootstrap 4 dropped Glyphicons. You can use [Font Awesome Icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) instead
