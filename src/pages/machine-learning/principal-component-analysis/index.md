Wikipedia Says, "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components (or sometimes, principal modes of variation)."

Principal component analysis(PCA) is a statistical technique used to examine the interrelations among a set of variables in order to identify the underlying structure of those variables.
