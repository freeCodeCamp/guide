## Area of a Triangle
The area of a triangle is defined as: 

**A = 1/2 x b x h**

where b and h represent the base and the height of the triangle, respectively

Key intuition: A triangle is half as big as the rectangle that surrounds it, which is why the area of a triangle is one-half base times height.
