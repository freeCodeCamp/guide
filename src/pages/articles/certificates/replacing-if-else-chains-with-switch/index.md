title: Replacing if Else Chains with Switch
---
If you have many options to choose from, a `switch` statement can be easier to write than many chained `if/if` else statements. The following:

    if(val === 1) {
      answer = "a";
    } else if(val === 2) {
      answer = "b";
    } else {
      answer = "c";
    }

can be replaced with:

    switch (val) {
      case 1:
        answer = "a";
        break;
      case 2:
        answer = "b";
        break;
      default:
        answer = "c";
    }
