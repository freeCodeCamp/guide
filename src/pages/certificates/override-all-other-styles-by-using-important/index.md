title: Override All Other Styles by Using Important
---
In many situations, you will use CSS libraries. These may accidentally override your own CSS. So when you absolutely need to be sure that an element has specific CSS, you can use !important.

An example of how to do this is: `color: red !important;` This will make sure that we use the wanted property regardless of other overrides.
