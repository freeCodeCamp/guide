UTF-8, which stands for Unicode Transformation Standard 8, is a Unicode standard developed by the Unicode Consortium.  Don't confuse Unicode with UTF.  Unicode is the character set where as UTF is the encoding of a character set.  This character encoding standard is default for HTML5 and was created specifically to address issues in multilingual environments.  UTF-8 is supported in HTML4, as well.  

Characters in UTF-8 range in length from 1 to 4 bytes and represents all Unicode standard characters.  It's completely backwards compatible with ASCII.  Though there are other standards still in use, including a new version, UTF-8 is still preferred for encoding e-mail and web pages.

A useful website that has a UTF-8 encoding table and Unicode characters can be found here: http://www.utf8-chartable.de/
