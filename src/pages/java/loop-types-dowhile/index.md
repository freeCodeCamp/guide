# The Java Do While loop

The `do while` is very similar to the `while` loop in the way it works, but is _exit controlled_ (unlike the `for` and `while` loops which are _entry controlled_), that is, the truth value of its `expression` is evaluated after the execution of `Statements`.

```java
do {
    // Statements
} while (expression);
```

This kind of loop is particularly useful if you want your `Statements` to be executed at least once, irrespective of what `expression` evaluates to. You want to do this if you are initializing a variable inside your loop and plan on using its value later.

```java
int iter_DoWhile = 20;
do{
    System.out.print(iter_DoWhile + " ");

    // Increment the counter
    iter_DoWhile++;
} while(iter_DoWhile < 10);
System.out.println("iter_DoWhile Value: " + iter_DoWhile);
```

Output:
```
    20
    iter_DoWhile Value: 21
```
