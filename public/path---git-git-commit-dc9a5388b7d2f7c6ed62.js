You can think of a commit as a snapshot of your project, where a new version of that project is created in the current repository. Two important features of commits are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you can recall the commited changes at a later date, or revert the project to that version <a href=\'https://guide.freecodecamp.org/git/git-checkout\' target=\'_blank\' rel=\'nofollow\'>see Git checkout</a></li>\n<li>if multiple commits edit different parts of the project, they will not overwrite each other even if the authors of the commit were unaware of each other. This is one of the benefits of using Git over a tool like Dropbox or Google Drive.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Options</h3>\n<p>There are a number of options that you can include with <code>git commit</code>. However, this guide will only cover the most common options. For an extensive list of options, please consult the <a href=\'https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit\' target=\'_blank\' rel=\'nofollow\'>Git documentation</a>.</p>\n<h4>The -m Option</h4>\n<p>The most common option used with <code>git commit</code> is the <code>-m</code> option. The <code>-m</code> stands for message. When calling <code>git commit</code>, it is required to include a message. The message should be a short description of the changes being committed. The message should be at the end of the command and it must be wrapped in quotations <code>" "</code>.</p>\n<p>An example of how to use the <code>-m</code> option:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-shell"><code>git commit -m "My message"</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>The output in your terminal should look something like this:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-shell"><code>[master 13vc6b2] My message\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If the <code>-m</code> is not included with the <code>git commit</code> command, you will be prompted to add a message in your default text editor.</p>\n<h4>The -a Option</h4>\n<p>Another popular option is the <code>-a</code> option. The <code>-a</code> stands for all. This option automatically stages all modified files to be committed. If new files are added the <code>-a</code> option will not stage those new files. Only files that the git repository is aware of will be committed.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>Let’s say that you have a <code>README.md</code> file that has already been committed to your repository. If you make changes to this file, you can use the <code>-a</code> option in your commit command to stage and add the changes to your repository. However, what if you also added a new file called <code>index.html</code>? The <code>-a</code> option will not stage the <code>index.html</code> as it does not currently exist in the repository. When new files have been added, the <code>git add</code> command should be invoked in order to stage the files before they can be committed to the repository.</p>\n<p>An example of how to use the <code>-a</code> option:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-shell"><code>git commit -am “My new changes”</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>The output in your terminal should look something like this:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-shell"><code>[master 22gc8v1] My new message\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h4>The —amend Option</h4>\n<p>The <code>--amend</code> option allows you to change your last commit. Let’s say you just committed and you made a mistake in your commit log message. You can conveniently modify the most recent commit using the command:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-shell"><code>git commit --amend -m "an updated commit message"</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>If you forget to include a file in the commit:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-shell"><code>git add FORGOTTEN-FILE-NAME\ngit commit --amend -m "an updated commit message"\n\n# If you don\'t need to change the commit message, use the --no-edit option\ngit add FORGOTTEN-FILE-NAME\ngit commit --amend --no-edit</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Premature commits happen all the time in the course of your day-to-day development. It’s easy to forget to stage a file or how to correctly format your commit message. The <code>--amend</code> flag is a convenient way to fix these minor mistakes. This command will replace the old commit message with the updated one specified in the command.</p>\n<p>Amended commits are actually entirely new commits and the previous commit will no longer be on your current branch. When you’re working with others, you should try to avoid amending commits if the last commit is already pushed into the repository.</p>',fields:{slug:"/git/git-commit/"},frontmatter:{title:"Git Commit"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/git/git-commit/"}}}});
