## Game Development

Game development is the process of building video or computer games. Early games were developed from scratch by a single person. Over the years the size and complexity of game titles has increased, and now most games are built by multi-discipline teams. These teams are usually split along the roles of programmer, artist and designer.

### Game Engines
Most commercial and non commercial games developed today rely on an engine provided by a 3rd party. This is due to the complexity of creating a full game from scratch.  The level of functionality provided by a game engine varies. At minimum they will provide an API for simplifying interaction with the hardware, such as the display, controllers and audio.  Most modern engines provide some kind of editor application for building game environments along with systems for 3D model rendering and animation, visual scripting, simulating physics and handling networked play.  The availability of high quality, feature rich game engines has massively reduced the entry level for a building game.

#### Commercial Cross-platform Engines
Commercial game engines are largely moving towards a free to use model. These can be freely downloaded but place licensing restrictions on the games produced using them. This may take form a royalty, the displaying of branding, or a requirement to use other services provided by the creators.

  * Unreal Engine
  * Unity
  * Amazon Lumberyard

#### Open Source Engines
In addition to the commercial engines available, there are a wide range of open source engines. These support various target hardware and development languages.

  * Godot
  * SuperPowers
  * Ogre
  * Torque
  * Blender Game Engine

### Coding Games
Programming games requires the same core skills as any other field of coding. Knowledge of algorithms, data structures, mathematics and logic are key fundamentals. Due to their real-time nature, games often have much tighter requirements for code performance than other types of application.

Any language can be used for making games, and the choice of language will be determined by personal preference, the target platform and the game engine used. For large, commercial game development, C++ is the most widely used language largely due to its speed and access to low level hardware. C# is also popular due to its use by the Unity engine. Objective C and Java are also commonly used on the iPhone and Android platforms respectively.

### Getting Started
Games development is difficult, requiring knowledge across a range of fields and constantly throwing up fresh challenges. Even simple games can take a significant amount of time and effort to complete. The largest obstacle to the beginner is finishing a project. For this reason, it is best to start by copying an existing simple game format and working on it to completion, with the aim of getting something you can play as quickly as possible. A large modern game is built by hundreds of developers over several years, so keep it small and don't be over ambitious. You won't create the next Call of Duty by yourself in a week.

* Download an engine, either a freely available commercial engine like Unreal or Unity, or an open source alternative like Godot.
* Choose a simple game to copy, such as Pong.
* Start building the game, concentrating on implementing the core mechanics, and avoid spending time on non essential tasks such as creating high quality artwork. Create crude placeholder art, or download free art resources. Some engines also have stores where you can buy prebuilt assets.
* Utilise the tutorials or documentation. Most game engines have great resources for teaching the fundamentals.
* Once your game is complete if you like it enough you can then spend time improving the non core aspect like the artwork, or you can move on to your next project.
* Choose a slightly more complicated game genre, such as a platformer, and repeat the process.
* When you have recreated several game types, feel free to jump in and tackle something a bit more original.

Once you've created something you're proud of, show it off to friends or on game development forums. Get feedback on what works and what doesn't. When you've been close to a game it can be difficult to judge how well it plays or how difficult it is, especially for beginners.

Most importantly, have fun!
