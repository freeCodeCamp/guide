## Adobe Experience Design

Adobe Experience Design, also known as Adobe XD, is a prototyping tool for UX designers. It's a tool that is specifically built for interface design and user experience, unlike other Adobe products like Photoshop and Illustrator which were meant for photo editing and graphic design. Adobe XD is available for both Windows and macOS, unlike Sketch which is exclusive to macOS. 

### Advantages: 

* in-built prototyping tools
* available on both Windows and macOS
* very clean and neat interface, unlike Photoshop. 
* easy for Sketch users to switch as interface is very similar
* repeat-grid feature
* directly include Illustrator and Photoshop assets

### Disadvantages

* no plugins available, unlike Sketch which has a huge ecosystem already in place
* limited prototyping options; lacks many features of dedicated prototyping tools like InVision or Framer
