## Symbols

HTML allows the use of symbols within it's code. Each symbol has a unique entity name and/or entity number. You must have `&` at the beginning and `;` at the end in order for it to work. 

For example, if you were to write the copyright symbol &copy;, your HTML code would look like this: `&copy;`.
