## Code Smells

Code smells is a special term meaning that a code was written badly, or illogically. In terms of software development, code smells can be introduced by too long methods or too many variables, making the code reading too difficult. Misleading comments, dead code, duplicate operations and high code complexity are amongst other examples of code smells. Basically any code writing practice, making it unreadable, hard too understand or too complex for other developers introduces a so-called code smell, which potentially might cause more issues in the further development.
