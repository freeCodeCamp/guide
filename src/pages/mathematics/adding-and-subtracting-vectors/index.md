## Adding and Subtracting Vectors

In linear algebra, the sum A+B of two vectors (A and B) is equivalent to the sum of the corresponding components of A and B. For instance, if Vector A is `{1, 3, 4}` and Vector B is `{2, 5, 9}`, the sum A+B is `{1+2, 3+5, 4+9} = {3, 8, 13}`.

Similarly, the difference A-B between two vectors (again, A and B) is equal to the difference between the corresponding components of A and B. The difference A-B with the above vectors is `{1-2, 3-5, 4-9} = {-1, -2, -5}`.
