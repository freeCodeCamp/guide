Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.

In HTML, links are defined with the <a> tag:

<a href="url">link text</a>

The href attribute specifies the destination address of the link.
The link text is the visible part.

Clicking on the link text will send you to the specified address.
