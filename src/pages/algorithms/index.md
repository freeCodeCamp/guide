## Algorithms

When you are doing a simple division or a complicated calculus problem (or even cooking some lunch using a recipe), you must use a predetermined set of rules, called an algorithm to solve it.

The root of the word lies in the 9th century Persian mathematician Al-Khwārizmī and his work on numbers.

Today some common types of algorithms include sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and compression algorithms.

Here is a short video from BBC explaining what an algorithm is:

freeCodeCamp's curriculum heavily emphasizes creating algorithms. This is because learning algorithms is a good way to practice programming skills, for intellectual stimulation as well as fun and profit. Interviewers most commonly test candidates on algorithms during developer job interviews.
