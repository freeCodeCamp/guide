## Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration is a modern software development process which is a major part of a 'DevOps' culture. Developers working within this environment commit their code multiple times per day on to a centralised platform to continuously ensure that the code passes its tests. 

The major benefit of this process is that it ensures developers can identify any bugs early on in the lifecycle of an application. This enables developers to remedy these bugs quickly and efficiently which in turn saves time in the development lifecycle.
 
Other benefits of Continuous Integration include collaboration. Continuous Integration requires developers to be constantly communicating, working together and working towards the same goals. This streamlines the development of an application and ensures development resources are used effectively with little waste.

Continuous integration software tools can be used to automate the testing and build a document trail. Common tools inclue Jenkins, TemaCity and Travis CI.
