## Onclick Event


In JavaScript, the "onclick" event happens when the user clicks on an element.

Let's look at the following HTML tag:

```html
    <button onclick="hello();">Say "Hello"</button>
```
And the following JavaScript:

```javascript
    function hello(){
      alert("Hello, World!");
    }
```

The function, "hello", will get executed every time the button above is pressed.
