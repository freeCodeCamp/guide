## Visited


The :visited CSS pseudo-class is used to select an anchor link (<a>) that the user has already visited.

Due to security issues, there are only a few styles that can be applied using the :visited selector: color, background-color, border-color, border-bottom-color, border-left-color, border-right-color, border-top-color, column-rule-color, and outline-color.

Syntax:

```css
:visited
```

## Example

```css
/* Selects any <a> that has been visited */
a:visited { 
    color: red;
}
```
