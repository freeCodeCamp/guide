## Area of a Triangle

When a triangle is a right triangle (in that one of its angles is a right angle, 90 degrees), two such triangles make a rectangle or a square. The area of a rectangle is length * width, or side * side for a square. 

Simiilarly, the area of a triangle = (1/2) base * height, where the area of one triangle is half that of a rectangle/square of the same side lengths.
