#### Page Layout:
Page layout is the term used to describe how each page of your document will appear when it is printed. In any Word processor (Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer etc), page layout includes elements such as the margins, the number of columns, how headers and footers appear, and a host of other considerations. As you design your pages, you can use the tools that any Word processor puts at your disposal in this regard. We have many features under page layout like:

#### Page Orientation:
Word processors offers two (2) page orientation options: Landscape and Portrait. Landscape means the page is oriented horizontally, while portrait means the page is oriented vertically.
#### Page Size:
By default, the page size of a new document is 8.5" by 11". Word processors have variety of pre-defined page sizes to choose from: Letter (8.5" by 11"), Legal (8.5" by 14"), Executive (7.25" by 10.5"), A3 (11.7" by 16.5"), A4 (8.27" by 11.69"), A5 (5.83" by 8.27"), A6 (4.13" by 5.83") and other page size.
#### Page Margins:
A margin is the space between the text and the edge of your document. By default, a new document's margins are set to Normal, which means it has a one-ince space between the text and each edge (Top, Bottom, Left, Right). Other page margins setting include: Narrow (Top: 0.5" Bottom: 0.5" Left: 0.5" Right: 0.5"), Wide (Top: 1" Bottom: 1" Left: 2" Right: 2"), Moderate (Top: 1" Bottom: 1" Left: 0.75" Right: 0.75") and others.
#### Page Numbering:
Word processors allow us to do page numbering in our document either at the top position or at the bottom position.It can also be aligned at the left, center or right.
#### Header and Footer:
This is a feature of the page layout that allow us to insert some text either at the head or foot of our document.
