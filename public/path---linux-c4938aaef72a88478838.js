The defining component of a Linux distribution is the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17,\n1991 by Linus Torvalds. Many Linux distributions use the word “Linux” in their name. The Free Software Foundation uses the name\nGNU/Linux to refer to the operating system family, as well as specific distributions, to emphasize that most Linux distributions are not\njust the Linux kernel, and that they have in common not only the kernel, but also numerous utilities and libraries, a large proportion\nof which are from the GNU project. </p>\n<p>The development of Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration. The underlying source\ncode may be used, modified and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone under the terms of its respective licenses, such\nas the GNU General Public License.</p>\n<p>Linux was first started as a clone of the MINIX operating system. Open source contributors added onto the kernel and expanded its\nhardware compatability. Linux’s hardware supoort and free licensing made Linux a popular choice for desktop and server computing in the\nmid 90s. Today, Linux is the most popular operating system in the world. It powers 90% of the world’s servers, and is the basis of\nGoogle’s popular Android operating system.</p>\n<p>There are also many versions of Linux designed to be run on personal computers, such as Debian or Ubuntu. More importantly, these\ndifferent versions of Linux (called distributions) allow the user varying degrees of personalization and control of the operating\nsystem. This means that users can choose their Linux distributions based on their wants and needs.  </p>\n<p>There is also Kali Linux which is used for advanced penetration testing and auditing. It has over 700 tools, to be able to use it\nefficiently you will need to know how to use command line. It is not advised for beginners.</p>\n<p>Popular distributions of Linux include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ubuntu</li>\n<li>Linux Mint</li>\n<li>CentOS</li>\n<li>RHEL</li>\n<li>Arch Linux</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Package types are split between higher-level distributions, with Debian (.deb) and Red Hat (.rpm) being two of the most commonly used,\nhowever there are others including Pacman (used for Arch Linux) and PetGet (Puppy Linux).</p>\n<p>Linux distributions also come in all shapes and size and most if not all offer the ability to run directly via CD / DVD in what’s known\nas a ‘Live CD’ environment or even directly via USB if your motherboard supports booting from USB.</p>\n<p>For more facts about Linux, read Quincy Larson’s article <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/linux-is-25-yay-lets-celebrate-with-25-rad-facts-about-linux-c8d8ac30076d">Linux is 25.
