## Hexcode

Numbers can be represented in various formats, such as binary (base 2) or decimal (the most known, which goes from 0 to 9). The hexadecimal representation is known also as base 16 or hex. Programmers use hexadecimal numbers (or hexcodes) in a large number of situations, such as representing colors.

A hexcode uses the symbols *0-9* to represent the values from zero to nine and the symbols *A, B, C, D, E* and *F* for the values from ten to fifteen. Each symbol of the hexcode equals to four bits. That means that representing a binary number such as ’0000 0000’ can be as simple in hexcode as ’00’. Taking this into account, the next table shows the value of all the sixteen symbols that a hexcode can have:

| Hex  | Decimal | Binary |
| :--: | :-----: | :----: |
| 0 | 0 | 0000 |
| 1 | 1 | 0001 |
| 2 | 2 | 0010 |
| 3 | 3 | 0011 |
| 4 | 4 | 0100 |
| 5 | 5 | 0101 |
| 6 | 6 | 0110 |
| 7 | 7 | 0111 |
| 8 | 8 | 1000 |
| 9 | 9 | 1001 |
| A | 10 | 1010 |
| B | 11 | 1011 |
| C | 12 | 1100 |
| D | 13 | 1101 |
| E | 14 | 1110 |
| F | 15 | 1111 |
