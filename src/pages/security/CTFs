## What is a CTF?

A CTF is something that allows you to practice and sharpen your cybersecurity skills. It is good for aspiring hackers and those
who just want to understand the mindeset of a hacker. Most involve finding a secret string, or a 'flag'.


## Good CTFs to try out...

[OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/)
This is a good CTF to practice Linux command line skills. It starts off easily and gets harder. There's an IRC channel where you
can ask for help and the site provides plenty of resources for each challenge. It is reccomended to start on the Bandit wargame
and go from there.

Feel free to add any CTFs you think are useful :)
