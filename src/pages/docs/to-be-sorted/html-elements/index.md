Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.

Opening tags look like this: `<h1>` and Closing tags look like this: `</h1>`.

Note that the only difference between opening and closing tags is that closing tags have a slash after their opening angle bracket.

There are also some HTML elements that are self-closing.

For example, the image tag `<img />` and the input tag `<input />`.
