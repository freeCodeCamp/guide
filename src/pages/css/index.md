### CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It was first invented in 1996, and is now a standard feature of all major web browsers.

CSS allows for developers to control how web pages look by "styling" the HTML structure of that page.

You can build some pretty amazing things in CSS alone, such as <a href='https://codepen.io/bali_balo/pen/BLJONk' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>this pure-CSS Minesweeper game</a> (which uses no JavaScript).

CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.
