# Bootstrap Cards
A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content,  
contextual background colors, and powerful display options.  
  
  
If youâ€™re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those components   
is available as modifier classes for cards.  
#### Sample code of bootsrap cards:  
```html
<div class="card" style="width: 20rem;">
  <img class="card-img-top" src="..." alt="Card image cap">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h4 class="card-title">Card title</h4>
    <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
  </div>
</div>
```  
Understanding the above classes:  
## Content types  
### Images  

`.card-img-top` places an image to the top of the card. With `.card-text`, text can be added to the card. Text within. 
`.card-text` can also be styled with the standard HTML tags.

### body  
The building block of a card is the `.card-body` Use it whenever you need a padded section within a card.  
### Titles, text, and links  
  
Card titles are used by adding `.card-title` to a `<h*>` tag. In the same way, links are added and placed next to each other. 
by adding `.card-link` to an `<a>` tag.  


Subtitles are used by adding a `.card-subtitle` to a `<h*>` tag. If the `.card-title` and the `card-subtitle` items are placed  
in a `.card-body` item, the card title and subtitle are aligned nicely.  
`<h*>` refers to any type of heading `h1`,`h2`,`h3`,`h4`,`h5`,`h6` ....
