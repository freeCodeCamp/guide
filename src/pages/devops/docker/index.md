## Docker
A Docker is an open source platform for containers that provides a lightweight application isolated virtualization that reduces system overhead. It also enables to create, run, and deploy applications as a single package to any kind of environment, without the consideration of differences between build and production environments.
### DevOps
DevOps (development and operations) is an enterprise software development phrase used to mean a type of agile relationship between development and IT operations. The goal of DevOps is to change and improve the relationship by advocating better communication and collaboration between these two business units.

###  How Docker implements DevOps
1.The developers donâ€™t have to worry about setting up the specific development environment every time. Instead, they need to focus on         building good quality code. This obviously leads to acceleration in the development efforts.

2.For IT operations team/Sysadmins, Docker makes it possible to set up environments that are exactly like a production server, and allow     anyone to work on the same project with the exact same settings, regardless of the local host environment.

3.Docker has been utilized in different DevOps applications, such as Puppet, Chef, Vagrant, and Ansible, for the task of automating the       provisioning of environments and the deployment of those environments.
