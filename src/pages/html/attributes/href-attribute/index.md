## Href Attribute

Href is short for "Hypertext Reference" and is an HTML attribute.  The href attribute is mainly used for `<a>` tags to specify the URL for a webpage the link leads to (whether it be on a different section of the same page, or on a completely different webpage).  

#### How to use
`<a href="URL"></a>`

#### Examples
```html
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">This is an absolute URL</a>

<a href="index.html">This is a relative URL</a>
```
