## Article

The `<article>` tag specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.

Potential sources for the <article> element:

Forum post
Blog post
News story
Comment

#### Example:

```html
  <article>
    <h1>freeCodeCamp</h1>
    <p>freeCodeCamp is a nonprofit organization that consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, Medium publications, and local organizations that intend to make learning web development accessible to anyone.</p>
  </article>
```




<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
