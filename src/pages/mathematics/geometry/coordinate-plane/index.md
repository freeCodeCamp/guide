## Coordinate Plane

The coordinate plane is often associated with René Descartes. Hence, it is also known as Cartesian coordinates system.

The 2-dimensional plane consists of a horizontal x-axis and a vertical y-axis.

The point (0, 0) marks the origin of the plane. Any point to the right or left of the origin has a positive or negative x-coordinate respectively. Correspondingly, any point above or below the origin has a positive or negative y value.
