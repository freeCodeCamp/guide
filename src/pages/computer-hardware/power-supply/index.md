## Power Supply

A power supply unit (or PSU) converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer. Modern personal computers universally use switched-mode power supplies. Some power supplies have a manual switch for selecting input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the mains voltage.

PSU's come in multiple specifications, which usually dictate their form factor. The type of power supply is named after the specification for the motherboard that it should power. Two popular specifications are Advanced Technology Extended (ATX) and Small Form Factor (SFX). An ATX PSU is typically 150 x 86 x 140 (Width, Height, Depth - millimeters).
