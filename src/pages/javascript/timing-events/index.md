JavaScript code is usually executed synchronously. We have some native functions called timers which allow us to delay instructions. These are the four timer types:

* `setTimeout()`
⋅⋅+ The most commonly used timer if you wish to delay and call a function once is the `setTimeout()`

* `setInterval()`
⋅⋅+ To set a delay for a function that should be repeated more than once, use the `setInterval()`. This is ideal for animations.

* `setImmediate()`
⋅⋅+ To setup a method to execute heavy operations, use the `setImmediate()`

* `requestAnimationFrame()`
⋅⋅+ To setup a metod that instructs the browser to perform an animation and also repaint the window for the next animation frame, use the `requestAnimationFrame()`.
