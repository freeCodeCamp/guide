Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. It is included as "vi" with most UNIX systems, which also includes Apple's macOS.

- persistent, multi-level undo tree
- extensive plugin system
- support for hundreds of programming languages and file formats
- powerful search and replace
- integrates with many tools
- built-in macro support for automation text manipulation


Vim has been the mainstay editor for the developer community for many years, but lately there has been a drastic shift to visual editor with more functionalities like Atom and Sublime Text. But once you get used to it, it can be one of the most flexible editors you've used. Its supporters swear by it.
