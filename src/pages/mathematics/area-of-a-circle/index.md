## Area of a Circle

Area of a circle is defined as the space enclosed by the circumference of the circle.

#### Terminology

Circumference (C) - The enclosing boundary of the circle is called circumference of the circle.

Radius (r) - The length of a line from any point on the boundary/cirumference of the circle to the centre of the circle is known as the radius of the circle.

Diameter (d) - The length of the line that passes across the circle through the centre of the circle, is called the diameter.

Pi (<span class="texhtml">π</span>) - A mathematical constant which is approximated as 3.14

#### Formula

###### Given radius of the circle
The formula for finding the area of a circle = A = π r²
r = radius
r² = radius x radius
π = 3.14
To find the area of a circle given the radius, multiply π (3.14) with r2 ( radius x radius).

Ex: r = 3
    π = 3.14
   
3.14 x 3² = 28.26

28.26 = area of circle

r2
Area of circle =  <span class="texhtml"><span class="texhtml">π</span> * <i>radius</i><sup>2</sup></span>

###### Given diameter of the circle

We know that `diameter = 2 * radius`, so you can derive the area of the circle as below,

Area of circle =  <span class="texhtml"><span class="texhtml">π</span> * <i>(diameter/2)</i><sup>2</sup></span>

###### Given circumference of the circle

We know that the circumference of the circle (C), 
<br>`C = 2 * π * (radius)`.
<br><br>From this,you can derive the area of the circle as below,

Area of circle =  <i>C</i><sup>2</sup></span> / 4 * <span class="texhtml"><span class="texhtml">π</span>
  
#### Examples

1. Given radius = 3cm, find area of the circle

     Area = 3.14 * 9 = 28.26 <span>cm<sup>2</sup></span>

2. Given diameter = 8cm, find area of the circle

     Radius = (Diameter/2) = 4cm

     Area = 3.14 * 16 = 50.24 <span>cm<sup>2</sup></span>

3. Given circumference of a circle = 25cm, find the area of the circle

     Area = 625 / (4 * 3.14) = 49.76 <span>cm<sup>2</sup></span>
