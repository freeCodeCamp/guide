## jQuery

jQuery is the most widely-used JavaScript library, and is used in more than half of all major websites. 

jQuery makes web development easier easier to use by providing a number of helper functions. These help developers quickly write DOM interactions without needing to manually writing as much JavaScript themselves.

jQuery adds a global variable with all of the libraries methods attached. The naming convention is to have this global variable as <code>$</code>. by typing in <code>$.</code> you have all the jQuery methods at your disposal.
