## Landing Page Testing

A landing page, as its own name says, it's the place your visitor lands its interest. The airport is the first place you see when you travel to another place by plane, right? The landing page works the same, and your mission is to create the best experience for those visiting, leading them to subscribe to your mailing or purchasing a service.
