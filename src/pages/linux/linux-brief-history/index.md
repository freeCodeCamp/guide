## Linux Brief History

GNU/Linux (commonly referred to as just Linux) is a free, open-source, customizable operating system based on the [Linux kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) and [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/) utilities and libraries.  It is developed by thousands of developers and used by millions of people, companies, and governments around the world. It is an alternative solution to other operating systems such as Windows and Mac OSX and has many different distributions or "flavors."  Some of the most popular distributions are [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/), [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/), [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/), [OpenSuSE](https://www.opensuse.org/), [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/), [Mint](https://linuxmint.com/), and [Solus](https://solus-project.com/). It includes software found in other OS's for common tasks such as running office applications, multimedia, graphics, and gaming. It also provides powerful tools for programming and web development. Linux is built to run on desktops, servers, Internet Of Things devices, and mobile devices ([Android](https://www.android.com/)).
