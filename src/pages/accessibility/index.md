## Accessibility
<strong>Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web</strong>.

More specifically, Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and that they can  contribute to the Web. Web accessibility also benefits others, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/soc.html#of" shape="rect">older people</a> with changing abilities due to aging.

Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that  affect access to the Web, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities. The document "<strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/Overview.html" shape="rect">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a></strong>" describes how different disabilities affect Web use and includes scenarios of people with disabilities using the Web.

Web accessibility  also <strong>benefits</strong> people <em>without</em> disabilities. For example, a key  principle of Web accessibility is designing Web sites and software that are flexible to meet different user needs, preferences, and situations. This <strong>flexibility</strong> also benefits people <em>without</em> disabilities in certain situations, such as people using a slow Internet connection, people with "temporary disabilities" such as a broken arm, and people with changing abilities due to aging. The document "<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/Overview" shape="rect">Developing a    Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization</a>" describes  many different benefits of Web accessibility, including <strong>benefits for organizations</strong>.

Some changes that can be made to make a website more accessible are:
<ul>
 	<li>Add proper and detailed alt tags to images, this helps people with disabilities such as blindness to interpret images by using a 'Text to speech' narrator.</li>
 	<li>Use Proper Formatting such as headings and subheading where needed in your page structure to help better organize the text.</li>
 	<li>Name your links with descriptive anchor text.</li>
 	<li>Full form of acronyms should always be mentioned at least once.</li>
 	<li>Avoid using tables as accessibility devices cannot understand them.</li>
 	<li>Try to add a sitemap so that not only search engines but disable people can also navigate your site with ease.</li>
 	<li>Include subtitles in videos to make sure people with hearing impairments don't miss out.</li>
 	<li>Use specific colors that won't prevent people with color blindness to read your content.</li>
</ul>
These should be kept in mind when designing every website so that disabled people can also benefit from the content you offer.
