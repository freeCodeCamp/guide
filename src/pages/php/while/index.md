## While Loops
A `while` loop executes statements within the loop as long as the loops condition is met. 

### Syntax:
```php
$x = 0;
while ($x < 11) {
    statement1;
    $x++;
}
```

**Note:** The block code must have a statement that changes or increments the condition.  Otherwise an infinite loop could result.
