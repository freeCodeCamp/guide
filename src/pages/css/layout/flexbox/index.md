Flexbox is a new way to structure content in CS3. It provides a wonderful way to create responsive websites that work well across different screen sizes and order content.

There are 3 simple steps to use flexbox.

1. Convert parent container to a flex container by using <i>display:flex;</i> in the css section
2. Adjust arrangement of different containers using <i>flex-direction</i>
3. Adjust individual items by using properties like justify-content, align-items etc.

Read on for more information for these properties :)
