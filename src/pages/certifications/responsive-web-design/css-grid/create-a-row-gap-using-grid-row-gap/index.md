## Create a Row Gap using grid-row-gap

This challenge requires you to add a gap of `20px` between all the rows of the CSS Grid in .container.

### Hint

To add a gap between the rows in a CSS grid, we use the `grid-row-gap` CSS property.

### Solution

Since the challenge has you adding a gap of `5px`, you would add the following line to the `.container` CSS code block.

````css
grid-row-gap: 5px;
````
