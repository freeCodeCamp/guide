Images can improve the design and the apperance of a web page.

In HTML, images are defined with the `<img>` tag.

The `<img>` tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The src attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the image:
`<img src="url">`

The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).
`<img src="" alt="your text here">`

You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image.
`<img src="" alt="your text here" style="width:500px;height:600px;">`

Alternatively, you can use the width and height attributes:
`<img src="" alt="your text here" width="500" height="600">`
