## Smart Contracts

Transactions in a blockchain are a very basic contract - One party sends resources to another.
In the Etherium blockchain transactions can support any kind of logic. They have the expressive 
power of a Turing-Complete machine - meaning they can be steps for a task that a computer can do.

As a piece of code that sits on the blockchain, a smart contract can automate tasks.
When an account receives money it can automatically distribute it to others.
This is entirely transparent so all the nodes(miners) can see what logic is being executed.
