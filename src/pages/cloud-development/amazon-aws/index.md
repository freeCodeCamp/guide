## Amazon Web Services
Amazon Web Services, or AWS for short, is a subsidiary of Amazon.com that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments. It along with Microsoft's Azure and Google's Cloud Platform are considered the three major public cloud vendors.

The technology allows subscribers to have at their disposal a full-fledged virtual cluster of computers, available all the time, through the internet. AWS's version of virtual computers have most of the attributes of a real computer including hardware (CPU(s) & GPU(s) for processing, local/RAM memory, hard-disk/SSD storage); a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, CRM, etc. Each AWS system also virtualizes its console I/O (keyboard, display, and mouse), allowing AWS subscribers to connect to their AWS system using a modern browser. The browser acts as a window into the virtual computer, letting subscribers log-in, configure and use their virtual systems just as they would a real physical computer. They can choose to deploy their AWS systems to provide internet-based services for their own and their customers' benefit.  

Popular AWS services include:
* Virtual Machines via the EC2 platform
* Databases including both SQL and NoSQL
* Games development via the Amazon Lumberyard game development engine and subsequent hosting platform.
* Application Monitoring tools
* Mobile development tools and platforms
* Amazon Alexa development area
