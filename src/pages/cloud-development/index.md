## Cloud Development

Cloud development is the usage of software engineering practices on infrastructure components in a shared resource pool. This can be done in multiple manners, within your company or organizations own data center, or in a "public" shared datacenter owned and operated by a third party.

Popular choices for Public Cloud providers are Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine. These providers operate clusters of massive datacenters whereby thousands of different individuals, companies, and organizations consume these resources. Operating the Cloud involves enabling the partitioning of these shared resources for the usage of these different users. The consumption of the resources is tracked (also referred to as metered) and then billed back to the user depending on the different financial scheme for the various compute, network, and storage resources consumed.

Many modern websites and big data efforts are said to be developed in the Cloud, meaning they are operating in some of these massive shared datacenters.

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS vendors offer a development environment to application developers. The provider typically develops toolkit and standards for development and channels for distribution and payment. In the PaaS models, cloud providers deliver a computing platform, typically including operating system, programming-language execution environment, database, and web server. Application developers can develop and run their software solutions on a cloud platform without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers. With some PaaS offers like Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud Platform and Google App Engine, the underlying computer and storage resources scale automatically to match application demand so that the cloud user does not have to allocate resources manually. The latter has also been proposed by an architecture aiming to facilitate real-time in cloud environments. Even more specific application types can be provided via PaaS, such as media encoding as provided by services like bitcodin.com
