title: Organize Local Group Events

In-person group programming sessions and events are fun!

## This Wiki will help you with organizing a successful Local Group event.

With a little planning and communication, having a successful Local Group event can be easy! Here are some steps to help you in doing this:

*   Determine the topic for the event (code and coffee, hack session, invite campers to another organization's event).

*   Find a suitable location. Local Group events should always take place in a public space (library, cafe, hackerspace).

*   Create an event on your Local Group's Facebook page for the event, and link to it on your Local Group Facebook Group page.

*   Follow-up with reminder posts for the event 1 week prior to the event and then again the day before the event.

*   On the day of the event, arrive early, get set up, greet members, and kick the event off. Don't forget to thank everyone afterwards and extend invites for future meetups.

**Try to take some pictures and post them on your Local Group's Facebook group page.**
