## Units

You can use two different forms of unit to define the size of your css elements, relative uints and absolute units.

## Relative units

Relative units take the value of other elements on the page</br></br>

### Examples of relative units:
<ul>
<li><b>em</b> 	Relative to the font-size of the element it is inside (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)
<li><b>rem</b> 	Relative to font-size of the root html
<li><b>%</b> Relative to a percentage the size of the container holding it
</ul>


</br></br>

## Absolute units

Absolute units are exactly what they sound like, absolute in value and will always stay the value you set it.</br>
For example, if you set an element to be 10px, they will always stay 10px regardless of screen size etc.</br></br>
### Examples of abosolute units:
<ul>
<li><b>px</b> meaning pixels gives an absolute pixel value to the element
<li><b>pt</b> meaning points, and often used as font sizes (1pt = 1/72 of 1in and .3528mm) 
<li><b>cm</b>  give an element a centimeter value
<li><b>in</b> gives a value in inches
</ul>
