Docker is an open-source container platform owned by Docker Inc. Containers have replaced virtual machines as they are lightweight and easily automated. 
Docker containers which run the guest OS share the host's kernel, eliminating the overhead caused by the hypervisor.
Docker container requires atleast one program to run, otherwise the container will be terminated. This aids in releasing resources to be used by other containers. 

Docker provides orchestration services via Docker Swarm, which competes with Kubernetes and Apache Mesos Marathon. 

Docker comes in both free and enterprise variants.

Docker containers are built using images hosted on Docker Registries such as Docker Hub and Docker Store, and can also be built locally, and also pulled from private registries.
