You might have come across "Lists" in whole guide
Lets talk about only list 
To declare a list 
list is like an array in other programming languages or you can just image a list (general one like a list of names or numbers).
``` 
a = [] # this is a list 
a = list() # another way to create a list 
```
Another example code 
```
a = [1,4 ,5 , 6, 7] list of numbers
# you can print 
print(a)
# or you can add lists too 
b = [3, 7,8]
# adding two lists in third list
c = a + b
print (c)

```
There are many cool things you can do using lists
