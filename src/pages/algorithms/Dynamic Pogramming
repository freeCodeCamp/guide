## Dynamic Programing

Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem by breaking it into subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again. Following are the two main properties of a problem that suggest that the given problem can be solved using Dynamic programming.

1) Overlapping Subproblems
2) Optimal Substructure
