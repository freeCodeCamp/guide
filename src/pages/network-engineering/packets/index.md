A packet is a data unit that is routable over packet switched networks. Packets are Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model Layer 3 Protocol Data Units (PDUs). Packets are addressed and routed using Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. There are several different communications protocols that operate at OSI Layer 3 and each has distinct control information. 
 
Packets are divided into control information and data (also called the "payload") . Control information is contained in the packet header. The information a packet header contains is protocol specific but includes the protocol being used and the source/destination IP addresses. Common Level 3 protocols include TCP, UDP, and ICMP among others.
