## Tensor Flow

<a href='https://www.tensorflow.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>TensorFlow</a> is an open source software library for Machine Intelligence.

With the aim of conducting research in these fascinating areas, the Google team developed TensorFlow.

## How it is used for Data Science
TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. 
Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the 
multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture 
allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile 
device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers 
working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization 
for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the 
system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.
