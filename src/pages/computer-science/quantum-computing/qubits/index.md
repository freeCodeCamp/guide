In Quantum Computing, a 'Qubit' is a unit of quantum information, the quantum analogue of a classical bit. 
It is a 2 state quantum mechanical system, such as the polarization of a photon, where the two states are vertical polarization or horizontal polarization. 

In a classical system, a bit would have to be in one state or the other. However, quantum mechanics allows the qubit to be in a superposition of both states at the same time, a property that is fundamental to quantum computing.
