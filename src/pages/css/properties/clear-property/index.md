## Clear Property

The `clear` property specifies whether an element can be next to floating elements that precede it or must be moved down below them.

The property values for `clear` are none, left, right, both, initial, and inherit.

This property is used after the `float` property is used to "clear" out the `float`.
```css
  clear: none;
  clear: left;
  clear: right;
  clear: both;
  clear: initial;
  clear: inherit;
```
