title: Finding a Remainder in JavaScript
---
The _remainder operator_ `%` gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

## Example

    5 % 2 = 1 because
    Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
    2 * 2 = 4
    5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)

## Usage

In mathematics, a number can be checked even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.

    17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
    48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)

**Note** Do not confuse it with _modulus_ `%` does not work well with negative numbers.
