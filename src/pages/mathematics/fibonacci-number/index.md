# Fibonacci Number

Fibinacci Number is a term of the <i>Fibonacci sequence</i> - series of integers, which startes with 1, 1, and is defined recursively: F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2). In other words, every number of <i>Fibonacci sequence</i> is the sum of the two previous ones:

n-Fibonacci number is an n-th term of the <i>Fibonacci sequence</i> and is usually denoted by F(n).
