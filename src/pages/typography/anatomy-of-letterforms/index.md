## Anatomy of Letterforms
The anatomy of Letterforms describes the different elements that make up printed letters in a typeface. The figure below shows the different parts of the letters in a typeface.

>Parts of a glyph: 1) x-height; 2) ascender line; 3) apex; 4) baseline; 5) ascender; 6) crossbar; 7) stem; 8) serif; 9) leg; 10) bowl; 11) counter; 12) collar; 13) loop; 14) ear; 15) tie; 16) horizontal bar; 17) arm; 18) vertical bar; 19) cap height; 20) descender line.

A typeface broadly consist of 3 different parts 1) **Strokes** 2) **Terminals** 3) **Space**

#### Strokes
Stroke refers to the main body of the letterform. They may be straight, as in letters like _l_, _z_, _k_, _v_ or curved like in _c_ or _o_. The different parts of the stroke are given below

* The imaginary line on which most characters sit is known as the **Baseline** (4).

* The capheight or **capline** (19) is another imaginary line depicting the height of all the uppercase alphabets.

* The imaginary horizontal line that marks the top edge of the lowercase letters is the **Meanline**.

* The **x-height** (1) is the height of the lowercase x. In other words it is the distance between the baseline and the meanline.

* The main vertical or diagonal stroke in a letterform is known as the **Stem** (7).

* The strokes that connect two lines in the capital letterforms of *A* and *H* or cross strokes in *t* is known as **Crossbar** (6).

* When the stroke of a lowercase letter rises above the meanline like in _l_ it is called an **ascender** (5). The **Ascender line** (2) is the imaginary line depicting the distance between the baseline and the top of the ascender.

* When the stroke of a lowercase letter falls below the baseline like in _g_ it is called a **descender**. The **Descender line** (20) is the imaginary line depicting the distance between the baseline and the bottom of the descender.

* An arching stroke as in the top of an _R_ is called a **Shoulder** or sometimes just an _arch_, as in _h_, _n_, _m_.

* A closed curved stroke is called a **Bowl** (10).

* The inferior diagonal stroke seen in _K_ and _R_ is called **Leg** (9).

* A short horizontal stroke seen in the center of _e_, _f_ and in the middle stroke of _E_ and _F_, is called a **Bar**.

* The longer horizontal Stroke on the top or bottom as seen in _E_ and _F_ is called the **Arm** (17).

* The dot above the lowercase _j_ and _i_ is called the **Tittle** or dot or a jot.

* The bottom part of the two-story _g_ is called a **Loop** (13).

#### Terminals
Terminals are the end of the strokes. They are of two types **Serif** and **Sans-Serif**. A seriffed terminal has proftusions on the edges which can be described as a wedge, bulbous, teardrop, slab, etc. Sans-Serif on the other hand does not have these extending features at the end of strokes. Sans-Serif is used often on digital displays these days since they have better legibility on lower resolution displays where serifs are hard to display.

#### Space
Space refers to the white space that is found between the letters and also inside letters like _o_ and _p_ with closed loops.
