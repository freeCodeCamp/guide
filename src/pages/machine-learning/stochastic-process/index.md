## Stochastic Process

A Stochastic Process is basically a process which is non-deterministic. Note that it may have a probability distribution and may not be completely random. For instance the process where a 2-sided _unfair_ coin is flipped again and again. Or for instance, direction a drop of water may take on a roughly plain surface (non-determinism here may arise due to occassional roughness which makes it hard to determine the path of the droplet).
