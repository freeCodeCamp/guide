## Focus Groups

### Definitions

* A group of people who have been brought together to discuss a particular subject in order to solve a problem or suggest ideas. - Cambridge Dictionary<br>
* A group of people brought together to give their opinions on a particular issue or product, often for the purpose of market research. -Collins English Dictionary

Î‘ focus group is a group of people gathered together because of their common characteristics, such as age, gender, occupation, income etc. Focus groups are formed in order for researchers to conduct a market research, for specific demographic groups. <br>

Unlike an interview, where the input comes from a single person, in focus groups we have different answers from various people which provide a more diverse and accurate insight in the market's needs and wants. Additionally, discussions in focus groups allow people to interact with each other, form new opinions and see different perspectives of the topic in question.
