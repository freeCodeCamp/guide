## Numbers
In Javascript there is no specific type of integers. It means you can use numbers with or without decimals in the same way.
```javascript
 var a = 12.5;    // A number with decimals
 var b = 3;       // A number without decimals 
 var c = -5       // A negative number
```
Javascript also allows use of scientific notations to write extra large or small numbers.
```javascript
 var x = 123e5;    // 12300000
 var y = 123e-5;   // 0.00123 
```
All numbers are implemented in [double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) which inlcudes a number between **-(253 -1) and 253 -1**.
