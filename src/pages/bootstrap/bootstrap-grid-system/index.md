## Bootstrap Grid System

In a nutshell Bootstrap grid system helps you create responsive layouts, it comprises of a system of rows and columns that helps you structure your content. 

Rows are horizontal groups of columns, with a maximum of 12 columns per row. Within each row, the content is placed inside the columns and it can span anywhere between 1 to 12 columns.

Bootstrap has five different types of grid tiers namely Extra small, Small, Medium, Large and Extra large, there is a breakpoint defined for each of these grid tiers.

Bootstrap uses pixels to define the grid tier breakpoints, the different viewport widths that act as breakpoints for the grid tiers are:

* Extra large: **Viewport width >= 1200px**
* Large: **Viewport width >= 992px**
* Medium: **Viewport width >= 768px**
* Small: **Viewport width >= 576px**
* Extra small: **Viewport widths below 576px**
