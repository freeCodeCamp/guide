## Game Development with Unreal Engine

Unreal Engine is a cross-platform game engine developed by Epic Games. The Unreal Engine was initially developed for the 1998 FPS title Unreal, but has been subsequently used for many thousands of commercial and non-commercial titles. The most recent version of the engine, Unreal Engine 4, targets PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Mac OS X, iOS, Android, many VR systems, Linux, SteamOS, and HTML5, and the editor can run on Windows, OS X and Linux.

Uscript is the engine's native scripting language, used for creating game code and gameplay events before the release of Unreal Engine 4, and was designed for high level programming.  The script was written and programmed by Tim Sweeney, also the creator of another scripting language, ZZT-oop.

Since 2015 the Unreal Engine has been free to use, with Epic charging a 5% royalty on sales of titles produced using the engine. Epic make the majority of their codebase freely available via their Github, although source for closed platforms such as the Playstation 4 and Xbox One is only available for registered platform developers.
