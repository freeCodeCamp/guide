## Use React to Render Nested Components

You have learned in earlier lessons, that there are two ways to create a React component:

1. Stateless functional component - using a JavaScript function.

2. Define a React component using the ES6 syntax.

In this quiz, we have defined two stateless functional components, i.e. using JavaScript functions. Recall, once a component has been created, it can be used using the component name inside HTML opening and closing brackets. For example, to nest component A inside parent component B, you'd simply put <A /> inside B. Try this with the TypesOfFruit and Fruits components.
