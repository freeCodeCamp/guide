## NPM

NPM is a package manager for the Web. When it was built, it was meant to assist in the downloading of Node.js packages for Javascript development so it was called Node Package Manager. However, NPM doesn't have a fullform as it's used not only for Javascript packages but for lots of purposes too. 

NPM is inbuilt in Node.js so you'll have to install Node.js before using NPM.

We can install a package by: 

```shell
    npm install <packagename>
```

For example:
```shell
    npm install jquery
```
