<!--
Thanks for contributing to the freeCodeCamp Guide! Before you open your pull request (PR), please make sure to do the following:

- Avoid a duplicate PR: search through the open pull requests to check that there is not a PR already open that writes the same article or makes similar changes
- Your changes pass the Travis CI build: any new folder you create in "src/pages" must have an index.md. All articles must have the following as the first three lines in the file:

---
title: Title of the article that shows up in the site's menu
---

- If you edit a stub article, your changes are substantial enough to justify removing the stub text ("This article is a stub..." part). We can't accept PRs that only add links to the "More Information" section - a repository script will automatically delete any changes (and revert it to the stub template) if the stub language is still in that file
- Your PR has a descriptive name (NOT: Update index.md): for example, if you create a "Variables" article inside the "Python" directory, the pull request title should be "Python: add Variables article". Other examples are "Git: edit Git Commit article" or "PHP: create PHP section and add Data Structures article"
- Add a short description below describing your changes
