### Game Development

We all know those evenings where we sat around our TVs, mashing buttons to make characters jump and interact on objects on screen and compete with our friends all night long. Those sessions gave way to the intense multiplayer matches of the late 90s and the early 2000's. And they gave way to the current modern era of gaming, awash with celebrities, competition and large prizes!

Game development refers to the complete process of making video games. There are innumerable aspects to Game Development, some of the most popular ones being 3D Modeling, Game Level Design as well as Writing, Storyboarding, Game Music Design.

The earliest games were non-commercial games and were made by hobbyists and people who were commited to their machines. Nowadays, "Indie" (short for Independent) studios, have been cranking award winning titles. The most famous ones being games like Thomas Was Alone and Limbo.

Being a game developer requires indigenous thought, creativity and a hunger to make an immersive experience to the player. The best games remembered by generations have not been the ones that stayed in mainstream. But, instead, titles like Half Life (where is HL3 , GabeN?), and Journey.
