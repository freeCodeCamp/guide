## Spikes

A Spike is a development task that is planned for like a <a href='https://guide.freecodecamp.org/agile/user-stories' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>User Story</a>, but focused on information instead of development. Agile processes do not typically include a dedicated research phase. Instead, Spikes are created as needed when a team does not believe that it has enough information to estimate the work required for a User Story or to create User Stories for a feature. Spikes are typically "timeboxed". Timeboxing is a way of handling tasks that don't have a clear endpoint by telling developers to accomplish as much as they can in a set time period.
