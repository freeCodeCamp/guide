## Definition of Mean
In statistics, the term _mean_ refers to the 'average' value in a collection of data. You can find this value by adding together all of the numbers and then dividing by the total number of values in the collection.

#### Example

The mean of ( 5, 8, 10, 12, 15 ) is 8:

_To find the mean we would find the sum of all of these numbers (40) and divide it by the number of values in the collection (5).  40/5 is 8, which is the average value in the collection._

#### Median and Mode
Mean is often confused with [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median), the value in the middle of the collection and [mode](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/mathematics/definition-of-mode), the value that occurs most frequently in the collection.
