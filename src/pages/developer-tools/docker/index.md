## Docker

 Docker is a software platform that allows you to quickly build, test, and deploy applications.  Docker creates standardized units called containers. These have everything the software needs to run. This  includes libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. 

 Docker has emerged as a standard platform that allows users to easily compose, create, deploy, and manage containers.  Docker allows a high degree of portability. Users can register and share containers over various private and public environments.  

 With Docker, you can treat containers like  lightweight, modular virtual machines. The developers gets flexibility with these containers. They can create, deploy, copy, and move them from environment to environment. 

 The Docker uses features of the Linux kernel to segregate processes so they can run independently. This independence gives containers the ability to run many processes and applications separately from one another. This make better use of your infrastructure. It also  retains the security you would have with separate systems. 

 The Docker technology brings more than the ability to run containers. It also eases the process of creating and building containers. Then  shipping these containers images for ease of use and installation. The simplicity of container management allows the versioning of images (among other things).
