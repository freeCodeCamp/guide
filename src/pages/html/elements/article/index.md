## Article

The `<article>` tag specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.

Potential sources for the `<article>` element:

* Forum post
* Blog post
* News story
* Comment

Example: 
```html
<body>
  <article>
    <h1>Google Chrome</h1>
      <p>Google Chrome is a free, open-source web browser developed by Google, released in 2008.</p>
</article>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The article tag is not supported in Internet Explorer 8 and earlier versions.</p>
</body>
```
Note: The `<article>` tag is new in HTML5.
