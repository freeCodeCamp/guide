## Area of a Triangle


### 1. Given base (b) and height (h)

     Area of triangle = 1/2*b*h
  


### 2. Given three sides (a,b,c) of the triangle (Heron's Formula)
  
  
    Computing S = (a+b+c)/2
  
  
    Area of triangle = sqrt((S*(S-a)*(S-b)*(S-c))
  


### 3. Given two sides (a,b) and the angle (c) formed by them following SAS property

  
    Area of triangle = 1/2*a*b*sin(c)
