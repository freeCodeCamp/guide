## Graphing Quadratics Vertex Form

Vertex form of a parabola's equation:

The point (h, k) is the vertex. When a is positive the parabola opens upwards.

When a is negative the parabola opens downwards.

When |a| < 1 the parabola is compressed vertically.

When |a| > 1 the parabola becomes narrower.
