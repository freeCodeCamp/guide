In color theory, a tonal value is produced by adding white, grey, or black to a selected color. This does not change the hue but does alter the colorfullness, also known as saturation. When discussing tonal value, there are three main terms that must be discussed: Tint, Tone, and Shade. 

Tint is the addition of white to a color. Tint can be used to highlight an area as well as begin to create the illusion of depth on an object.

Tone is the addition of grey to a color. The tonal color creates a more muted and less saturated color.

Shade is the addition of black to a color. Shade can be used to darken and area to create the illusion of depth on an object.

By altering a colors tonal value, you can create the illusion of depth in images as well as alter the saturation level to better apply color for a desired emotion or mood.
