## Pythagoras Theorem

Pythagoras's Theorem relates the three sides of a right triangle. A right triangle is a triangle in which one the angles is a right angle (a 90-degree angle). The side of the triangle that is opposite to the right angle is called hypotenuse.

Let c be the length of the hypotenuse, a and b the length of the other sides.

The theorem states:

c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>

Whenever you are given two sides of a right triangle, you can calculate the third one using Pythagora's Theorem.
