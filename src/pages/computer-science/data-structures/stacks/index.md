## Stacks

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which operations are performed.
The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). To understand it better, you can think of a stack of plates, the one put last is going to be removed from the stack first. A practical example of it is the Undo Operation. The last operation performed is undone.

The major operations performed on stack are:
1. Push(x): The element x is pushed to the stack.
2. Pop() : The last element is popped out.
3. Peek() : You get to know what the first element is.
4. isEmpty() : You get to know if the stack is empty or not.
