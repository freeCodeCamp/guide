### CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It was first invented in 1996, and is now a standard feature of all major web browsers.

CSS allows for developers to control how web pages look by "styling" the HTML structure of that page.

CSS, are a way to change the look of HTML and XHTML web pages.

The current version of CSS is CSS3. CSS4 is available, but is split into parts.


One advantage to using CSS is a web page can still be displayed and understood, even if the CSS is not working or removed.

CSS code is saved in files with the .css file extension.

You can build some pretty amazing things in CSS alone, such as <a href='https://codepen.io/bali_balo/pen/BLJONk' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>this pure-CSS Minesweeper game</a> (which uses no JavaScript).
