A command-line interface or command language interpreter (CLI), also known as command-line user interface, console user interface
and character user interface (CUI), is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands 
to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines).
A program which handles the interface is called a command language interpreter or shell.
