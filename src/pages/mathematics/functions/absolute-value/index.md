## Absolute Value

The absolute value of a real number is its non-negative value without regard to its sign. When considered in terms of a number line, it is the distance between the point that corresponds to the number and the origin. The latter interpretation can be generalized for complex numbers as well, in the sense that the absolute value of a complex number can be conceived of as the distance between the point in the complex plane associated with the complex number and the origin.
