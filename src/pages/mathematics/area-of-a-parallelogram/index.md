## Area of a Parallelogram

A parallelogram is a 4-sided shape formed by two pairs of parallel lines. Opposite sides are equal in length and opposite angles are equal in measure. To find the area of a parallelogram, multiply the base by the height.

**Example**: Find the area of a parallelogram with a base of 12 centimeters and a height of 5 centimeters.

#### Area = *Base * Height* = 12 * 5 = **_60cm<sup>2</sup>_**
