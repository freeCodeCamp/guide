## Steganography
Steganography is a type of cryptography that provides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability">plausible deniability</a> by concealing a message. Whereas the existence of an encrypted channel in itself can be incriminating, a steganographic message will make it possible to deny that communication took place at all.

## Etymology
 The word steganography combines the Greek words "steganos" meaning "covered, concealed, or protected," and "graphein" meaning "writing".

### History
In the past, messages were hidden, for example, with lemon juice on a sheet of paper or with false letters containing more information than they seemed.
It was even common to shave the hair, in order to write a message on the skull, and then to let the hair grow back and finally reappear when the recipient was present to read the information.

### Digital steganography
Today, computer techniques have further improved these processes.It is possible to hide information in all kinds of files, including images, texts, music
