## Terraform

Terraform is an infrastructure as code software by HashiCorp. It allows users to define a datacenter
infrastructure in a high-level configuration language, from which it can create an execution plan to
build the infrastructure in a service provider such as OpenStack or in a service provider such as 
IBM Cloud (formerly Bluemix), AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform. Infrastructure is defined
in a HCL Terraform syntax or JSON format.
 
### Reasons to consider Terraform as one of your DevOps tools
 
- Terraform lets you define infrastructure in config/code and will enable you to rebuild/change and track changes to infrastructure with ease. Terraform provides a high-level description of infrastructure.
- Terraform is the only sophisticated tool that is completely platform agnostic as well as supports other services while there are a few alternatives but they are focused on a single cloud provider.
- Terraform enables you to implement all kinds of coding principles like having your code in source control, the ability to write automated tests, etc
- Terraform is the right tool for infrastructure management as many other tools have a severe impedance mismatch from trying to wrangle an API designed for configuring management to control an infrastructure environment. Instead, Terraform matches correctly with what you want to do- the API aligns with the way you think about infrastructure.
- Terraform has a lively community and is open source, there is a massive community developing around this tool. Many people are already using it, and it’s easier to find people who know how to use it, plugins, extensions, professional support, etc. This also means Terraform is evolving at a much faster rate. They do releases very often.
- Terraform’s speed and operations are exceptional. One cool thing about Terraform is, it’s plan command lets you see what changes you’re about to apply before you apply them. Code reuse feature and Terraform tends to make most changes faster than similar tools like CloudFormation.
