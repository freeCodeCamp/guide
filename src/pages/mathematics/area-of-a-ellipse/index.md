## Area of an Ellipse

An ellipse is a 2D shape defined by a continuous curve and two focus points. The sum of the two distances from the foci to any  point on the curve is constant. 

#### Terminology
* Foci or focus points - these points are equidistant from the center of the ellipse
* Major axis - the line drawn cutting the ellipse in half and running through both foci
* Minor axis - the line drawn cutting the ellipse in half and running between both foci

##### Formula

Area of ellipse =  <span class="texhtml"><span class="texhtml">(π)</span>(1/2)(major axis)(1/2)(minor axis)</span>

##### Example

Given major axis = 2 in, minor axis = 7 in find area of the ellipse.<br><br>

Area = 1/2 * 2 in * 1/2 * 7 in * π = 11 in<sup>2</sup>
