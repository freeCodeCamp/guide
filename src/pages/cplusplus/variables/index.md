title: Variables
---

Lets discuss something know as variables. Variables are like a bucket. You can put something in it and then change it 
afterwards when needed.
In C++ there are many types of variables like Integers, Strings, Booleans and many other.
Lets look at a simple program using integer variables.Integers can store simple positive and negative values like 0, 1, -1 
and so on. Any positive or negative value without decimal is an integer. Lets look at a simple program which uses an integer 
variable.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std ;
int main()
{
    int a;          // Declare an integer variable a
    a = 5;          // Assign value of 5 to variable a
    cout << a;      // Display the value of variable a which contains 5
    return 0;
}
```

When you execute this program you will see 5 displayed on the screen

* On line 5 n simple integer variable is declared.

* On line 6 the value 5 is assigned to the variable a. Now whenever we use the variable a in our program its value will be 5
  unless we change it.
* On line 7 we display the value of variable a and 5 is printed on the screen.
### Scope of Variables
All the variables have their area of functioning, and out of that boundary they don't hold their value, this boundary is called scope of the variable. For most of the cases its between the curly braces,in which variable is declared that a variable exists, not outside it. We will study the storage classes later, but as of now, we can broadly divide variables into two main types,

*Global Variables.

*Local variables.

#### Global variables

Global variables are those, which ar once declared and can be used throughout the lifetime of the program by any class or any function. They must be declared outside the main() function. If only declared, they can be assigned different values at different time in program lifetime. But even if they are declared and initialized at the same time outside the main() function, then also they can be assigned any value at any point in the program.

Example : Only declared, not initialized.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int x;                // Global variable declared
int main()
{
 x=10;                 // Initialized once
 cout <<"first value of x = "<< x;
 x=20;                 // Initialized again
 cout <<"Initialized again with value = "<< x;
}
```

#### Local Variables
Local variables are the variables which exist only between the curly braces, in which its declared. Outside that they are unavailable and leads to compile time error.

Example :

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
 int i=10;
 if(i<20)        // if condition scope starts
  {
    int n=100;   // Local variable declared and initialized
  }              // if condition scope ends
 cout << n;      // Compile time error, n not available here
}
```

### Constant Variables
Constant variable are the variables which cannot be changed. For example, if you needed "pi" in your code, you would not want to change it after initialization.

Example :

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const double PI = 3.14159253;
int main()
{
//Calculating the area of a circle, using user provided radius
double radius;
//input and output explained in other guide
cin>>radius;
//pi*r^2
double area = PI*radius*radius;
cout<<area<<endl;
}
```
