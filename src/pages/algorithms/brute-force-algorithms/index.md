## Brute Force Algorithms
Brute force algorithms are much like a trial and error process where you keep trying various possible figures till you find a solution.But unlike trial and error process, selection of figure happens in a specific order.

A very simple example of brute force algorithm is linear search, In which you sequentially checks each element for the given value till a match is found or till there is no elements left to be searched.

Brute force algorithm is very simple to implement and always works.
Brute force algorithms are slow and can only be used for limited problem size.
