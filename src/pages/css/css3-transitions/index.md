`transition-property` | The properties to a a transition to. Defaults to `all`.
`transition-timing-function` | A keyword or function that controls the intermediate values of the transition. Defaults to `ease`.

#### Eamples:

```CSS
// Default
transition: all 0s 0s ease;

// Only background-color
transition: background-color 3s;

// Custom timing function
transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.1);
```
