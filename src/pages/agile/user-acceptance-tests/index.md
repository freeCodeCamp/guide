## User Acceptance Tests

What are User Acceptance Tests? As the name suggests, they are acceptance tests performed by the intended users of the system! The goal of these tests is to gain some confidence that the product meets the needs of the end user, and behaves in the way that they expect.

User Acceptance Testing may also be called End User Testing. The term is often shortened to the acronym UAT. User Acceptance Tests are typically performed towards the end of the software development lifecycle, when the software is complete or nearly complete. UAT is not done typically to find bugs or ensure the functional requirements are met - this kind of system should have already been completed.

The benefits of User Acceptance Tests are that the people performing them can subject the system to its most typical usage. They can use realistic data, they can take the system through common journeys, and they provide a different perspective to the people on the development team. If the User Acceptance Tests pass, then this will give real confidence that the system will perform well when it is given a final release.

A drawback of User Acceptance Tests is that it is typically done late in the development cycle and therefore it can be hard to incorporate any user feedback into the final release. However, the feedback can be kept for future releases or updates. Furthermore, in agile, it may be possible to perform User Acceptance Tests earlier, using an iteration of the product rather than the final release.

A typical example of User Acceptance Testing is **Beta Testing**. This involves end users taking a nearly complete version of the release onto their own environment, and running the system through their typical system usage.
