## User Acceptance Tests (UAT)

In the process of Software Development the UAT plays a significant role which is popularly known as "Beta Testing". This testing is a real world testing and is performed by a real world user of the particular applications. The feedback from this testing is forwarded to the development team for any specific changes.

#### Why do we need UAT

* Requirement changes might not have communicated to the developers

* The software may not be delivering actually what it meant for

* Some logic or business process may need user's attention


#### What is required before we start UAT

* Complete requriement is signed off and is available as documented

* The code is in working or in demoable condition

* UAT is environment is ready for access

* There should not be any defect which will break the code

* Test data prepared in accordance with the LIVE scneario

#### Framework & tools used

* FitNesse
