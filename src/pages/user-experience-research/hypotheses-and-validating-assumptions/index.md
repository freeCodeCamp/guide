## Hypotheses and Validating Assumptions

### What is a Hypothesis?
A hypothesis is an a preposition that is presented by a scientist to explain a natural phenomenon. It is assumed for the purpose of argument, or to account for a fact or an occurance. It does not become a theory until it is proved and tested under different conditions and circumstances.

### What is Assumption?
An assumption is any statement believed to be true. 

### What is the difference between the two?
Anything taken for granted is an assumption. A hypothesis is at best a working assumption.

### What is Validating Assumptions?
Before you decide what to build think about what assumptions are being made. After identifying them, you should validate your assumptions.

Validating assumptions is the testing of decisions associated with the product. To test if the assumptions are true, you can develop a hypothesis relevant to the assumption and the business problem.

### An example of Validating Assumptions
You wish to develop an ice-cream business.

One of the assumptions may be that most kids like to eat ice-cream.

If you wish to develop this business in city X, you might want to test the following hypothesis: More than 50& of the children in city X eat ice-cream.
