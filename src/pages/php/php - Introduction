## PHP -INTRODUCTION
PHP(HYPER TEXT PREPEROCESSOR) is a programming language that can do all sorts of things: evaluate form data sent from a browser, build custom web content to serve the browser, talk to a database, and even send and receive cookies.
Lets dvelve into basic coding with PHP:

1. Hello World Script in Php

Code :

<html>
   
   <head>
      <title>Hello World</title>
   </head>
   
   <body>
      <?php echo "Hello, World!";?>
   </body>

</html>

Result:

Hello, World!

There are three basic ways of writing php code such that it is recognisable by the php parser:

1. <?php PHP code goes here ?>

2. <?    PHP code goes here ?>

3. <script language="php"> PHP code goes here </script>
