# Android Development

Android apps can be a great, fun way to get into the world of programming. Programmers can use Java or Kotlin to develop for Android, and the possibilities are endless.

From simple games and utility apps to full-blown music players, there are many opportunities to create something meaningful with Android. The Android developer community is widespread, and the documentation and resources online are easy to find, so that you can tackle any issue you're facing.

There is definitely a learning curve to get used to the Android framework, however once you understand the core components that make up the app, the rest will come naturally.

The learning curve involved in Android has a relatively smaller slope as compared to learning other technologies such as NodeJS. It is also relatively easier to understand and make contributions towards AOSP hosted by Google. The project can be found [here](https://source.android.com/) 

## Getting started
Check out the guides in this folder to learn about the 4 core components that make up an Android app and how you can get started with a sample app, and then delve into the more advanced topics such as fragments and the Gradle build system. Then check out the material design specifications guide as well to learn how to make your apps beautiful and user friendly.

Lastly, learn to integrate 3rd party libraries and Firebase services to add functionality to your app.
