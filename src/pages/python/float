Python supports four different numerical types including int (signed integers), long (long integers), complex (complex numbers) and float (floating point real values) Floats represent real numbers and are written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts. Floats may also be in scientific notation, with E or e indicating the power of 10 (2.5e2 = 2.5 x 102 = 250).

The term floating point is derived from the fact that there is no fixed number of digits before and after the decimal point; that is, the decimal point can float. There are also representations in which the number of digits before and after the decimal point is set, called fixed-pointrepresentations.

The syntax for float() is: float([x])

float() Parameters
The float() method takes a single parameter:

x (Optional) - number or string that needs to be converted to floating point number
If it's a string, the string should contain decimal points
