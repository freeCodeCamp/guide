# Prime Numbers

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

## Example
1. 5 is a prime number because:
    * 5/1 = 5 with a remainder 0 
    * 5/2 = 2 with a remainder 1 
    * 5/3 = 1 with a remainder 2 
    * 5/4 = 1 with a remainder 1 
    * 5/5 = 1 with a remainder 0  
    So 5 is only divisible by 1 and itself.
2. 4 is *not* a prime number because it is divisible by 2 (and 1 and itself)
