## Div Tag

The `<div>` tag defines a section in your HTML document. The `<div>` element is used to group large sections of HTML elements together and format them with CSS.

### Example
Here is an example of how to display a section in same color:

```html
<div style="color:#ff0000">
  <h3>my heading</h3>
  <p>my paragraph</p>
</div>
```

Div tag is a placer holder for different elements on the page. Think of it as a container for all your little HTML code bricks.
