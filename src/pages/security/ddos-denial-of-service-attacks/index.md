## DDoS Denial of Service Attacks

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make a resource (e.g. site, application, server, network) unavailable to legitimate users by having multiple systems overwhelm the target with traffic or sending it information that triggers a crash. 

Common DDoS attacks include:
<ul>
<li>**Traffic attacks**: Traffic flooding attacks send such a large volume of TCP, UDP and ICPM packets to the target that legitimate requests get lost. These attacks may also be accompanied by malware exploitation.</li>
<li>**Bandwidth attacks**: This DDos attack overwhelms the target with a lot of junk data in order to cause congestion, a loss of network bandwidth and equipment resources, and result in a complete denial of service.</li>
<li>**Application attacks**: Application-layer data messages can deplete resources in the application layer, disabling functions and features of a website.</li>
</ul>

The distribution of hosts that defines a DDoS attack enables the attacker to:

<ul>
<li>leverage more machine power to execute a major attack</li>
<li>mask the location of the attack due to the random distribution of attacking systems (often worldwide)</li>
<li>make the issue more difficult to address (e.g. shut down multiple machines than one)</li>
<li>hide the true attacking party since they would be disguised behind many (mostly compromised) systems</li>
</ul>

While no one can completely protect against DDoS attacks, one can better prepare by assessing risk and building a resilient network that combines architecture and procedures to limit the possibility and effects of systemic failure.
