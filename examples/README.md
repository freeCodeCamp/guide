# Gatsby example websites

Example websites site on one or the other end of the spectrum from
very simple to complex/complete.

Simple websites are to demonstrate a specific technology/plugin/technique to
help understanding how to accomplish a simple task. They should be named `using-*`
e.g. `using-sass`.

Complex/complete websites are for studying how to build more complex websites.

## Running an example site

1. Enter one of the sites (e.g. `cd gatsbygram`)
2. Install the dependencies for the site `npm install`
3. Run the Gatsby development server `gatsby develop`

## Checklist for building an example website

* Free of errors
* Has Google Analytics setup
* Notifications setup to ping PRs on success/failure of build
* For `using-x` websites, link to the site from the the plugin README
and to the plugin(s) from the website.
