## What is Julia?

<a href='https://julialang.org' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Julia</a> is a 
high-performance, optionally-typed programming language aimed for scientific and numerical computing. It features libraries for linear algebra, numeric optimization, signal processing and machine learning among others. It uses multiple dispatch and has an LLVM backend and JIT compiler.
