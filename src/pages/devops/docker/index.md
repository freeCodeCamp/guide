## Docker

Docker is a technology (sponsored by the company Docker inc) which provides developers a way to package and organize software into units, termed 'containers' in the Docker ecosystem. 

Here are some reasons it can be a good idea to seperate an application and its dependanceis into containers:

- Run programs in isolation - to mitigate side affects
- Due to being smaller and lightweight (in the code size sense) containers can run in parallel on a single server or Virtual Machine (VM)
- Through the forced container architecture, large codebases may become simpler to manage
- Reduces conflicts between developers who may be running software on the same infrastructure

A Docker container is a stand-alone executable package and therefore includes everything needed to run it: The code, sytem tools, libraries and settings.
