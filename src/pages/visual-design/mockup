# Mockup

Typically mid to high fidelity, mockups reflect the design choices for color schemes, layouts, typography, iconography, 
the visuals of navigation, and the overall atmosphere of the product.

In addition to setting aside time to answer the important visual questions, mockups have several other benefits:

*__Intuitive to stakeholders__.- Thanks to their higher fidelity, mockups require less context than lo-fi documents 
like wireframes. Stakeholders can more easily see the final product.

*__Realistic perspective__.— It’s one thing to have all your visual decisions made, but it’s another to see them all working 
together in a way close to the real thing. Mockups can help reveal problems that aren’t so apparent on paper (for example, 
color clashes, or smaller type crimes going unnoticed).

*__Early revisions__.— It’s easier to make revisions in a mockup than in the later coding stages (as long as the mockup itself 
isn’t coded).

In the design process, mockups come at the end of the lo-fi phase and the beginning of the hi-fi phase. This could mean 
different things for different methods — for example, a mockup could be made immediately after wireframing, or could be 
postponed until after some lo-fi prototype testing.

It is also recommend testing when transitioning from lo-fi to hi-fi, however. Big picture concepts like navigation and flow 
are harder to change in high fidelity, and so should be iterated before you dive into a hi-fi mockup.
