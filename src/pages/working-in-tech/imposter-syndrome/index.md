## Imposter Syndrome

A feeling of _being a fraud_ or _not good enough_ to get the job done. Common among software engineers, developers and designers working in tech companies. People suffering from imposter syndrome have a sense of inadequacy and insecurity concerning their ability to make a contribution at the workplace. In reality, they may be perfectly capable of and do contribute successfully to their tasks.

These thoughts are fairly common if you suffer from imposter syndrome:


* "What am I doing here?" 
* "I am not a developer. I am fooling myself and other people" (feels fake)
* "My colleagues are much smarter than me and I don't think I could ever match up to them" (undermines own achievements)
* "My coworkers have told me I've achieved a lot, but I feel like it's never enough" (discounts praise)
* "I have no idea how I got through the interview process" (feels only luck dictates results)
* "People are going to realise that I am not as smart as I potrayed in the interview and I will be ridiculed and fired for this" (fears failure)
* "My IQ is not high enough to work here"

So, it isn't something we conquer once. We conquer it every day, every time we take on a project, task, etc.
