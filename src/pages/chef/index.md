## Chef

Chef is an automation tool that provides a way to define infrastructure as code. Infrastructure as code (IAC) simply means that managing infrastructure by writing code (Automating infrastructure) rather than using manual processes. 

Chef automates the process of managing configurations, ensuring that every system you’re responsible for is configured correctly and consistently. Because Chef applies updates dynamically, you can make conditional changes based on their running environment or hardware, ensuring that the same code that configures development can be used all the way through to production. Chef’s built-in “test & repair” behavior means that systems can update their configurations continuously, and Chef will only take action when machines diverge from their desired state. Chef makes your infrastructure configurations testable, portable, and auditable, giving your teams the freedom to focus on building new innovations, rather than re-solving old problems.
