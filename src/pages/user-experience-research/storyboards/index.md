## Storyboards

Storyboards are used to paint a visual picture of a user's journey with a product or software. 

Storyboarding involves using visual images to create a story. This creates a more lasting impression than plain text. 

As a best practice, it's the first sketch of the expected functionality of a project (e.g. a website, application, service, etc.). It has the purpose to aid in the planning of the requirements of the project and to outline the necessary steps (workflow) that completing a task requires. For instance, a sketch of an authentication web page lays out (before any code), what type of data is required from the user, what actions are necessary to perform in the back end, and what is the expected output of the action.
