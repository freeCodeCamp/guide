## Ddos Denial of Service Attacks

Ddos, or Distributed Denial of Service attacks are cyber attacks that result in a target system being bombarded by artificially high traffic volume.  This differs from just a Dos attack in that many devices (usually a botnet) are performing the attack, instead of just one.  

This attack vector is becoming more common than ever due to the spike in the Internet of Things (Iot) devices.  Usually these Iot devices are infected with malware that leads them become part of the botnet that can perform a Ddos attack.
