## Scrummasters

Let's rapidly recall the scrum methodology: Scrum is a practice under <em>agile development</em> that allows a team (usually of developers but not exclusively) to self-organize and make changes or decisions in a swift manner. 

So, the scrum master is a member of a Scrum team who manages the process for how information is exchanged.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Wikipedia</a> refers to ScrumMaster as:

Facilitator of Scrum methodology, the one who is "accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables. The scrum master is not a traditional team lead or project manager but acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences. The scrum master ensures that the Scrum framework is followed. The scrum master helps to ensure the team follows the agreed processes in the Scrum framework, often facilitates key sessions, and encourages the team to improve."<sup>1</sup>

Since Scrum does not believe in the power of decision of a single individual the Scrum master appointed is, usually, a voted element of the team. Indeed, the main responsibility of a ScrumMaster as a facilitator is made easier if it is the team as a self-organized being (or a manager) the ones who choose the person who shall be given the responsibilities of this post.

<cite>During the daily meetings, which are sometimes called <em>scrums</em>, the ScrumMaster asks the team members these three questions: 

1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What will you do today?
3. Are there any impediments in your way?</cite> <sup>3</sup>

These questions serve as a support for the team's consensus which is guided by the ScrumMaster but it's every member's responsibility to backup each other as needed.
