## 2 by 2 Determinants

For a 2Ã—2 matrix, its determinant is found by subtracting the products of its diagonals, which is a fancy way of saying in words what the following says in pictures:

## Properties of 2 by 2 determinants

The rows and vectors of a 2 by 2 matrix can be associated with points on a cartesian plane, such that each row forms a 2D vector. These two vectors form a parallelogram, as shown in the image below. The absolute value of the determinant is equal to the area of the parallelogram.

Note: If the determinant equals zero, there are no solutions (intersections) to the system (aka the lines are parallel).
