SQL Injection

SQL is a query language used to communicate with databases. Critical data for websites and services are stored on servers. Many of these 
servers use SQL to manage their databases.

SQL injection is when a person uses specially crafted SQL statements to get a server to give up information that it shouldn't. This works
through vulnerabilities in SQL that allow the SQL server to run malicious code.
