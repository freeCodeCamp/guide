## Pythagoras Theorem


The Pythagorean Theorem states that:

*"The area of the square built upon the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares upon the remaining sides."*

The Pythagorean Theorem stated algebraically is:
 ```
 a^2+b^2=c^2
 ```
for a right triangle with sides of lengths a, b, and c, where c is the length of the hypotenuse.
