INTRODUCTION-
Ever seen images in website , Well now we can too insert images in our website using HTML. It's very easy to use.All we have to use is a tag -> <img>. This tag is used to insert images on web pages and uses two attributes: src and alt.

src- This attribute provides the url to image present either on your P.C./Laptop or to be included from some other website. Remember the link provided should not be broken otherwise the image will not be produced on your webpage.

alt- This attribute is used to overcome the problem of broken image or incapability of your browser to not being able to produce image on webpage. This attribute as name suggests provide "Alternative" to image which is some 'TEXT' describing the image

EXAMPLE-
<img src="codingme.jpg" alt="A code snippet">
Hence if browser cannot find this image, it will display the value of the alt attribute , i.e. "A code snippet".
