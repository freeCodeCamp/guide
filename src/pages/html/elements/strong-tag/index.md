=======
The `<strong>` tag is used to give importance to text in an HTML document. This can be done by wrapping the text you would like to be emphasized in an `<strong>` tag. Most browsers will render text wrapped in an `<strong>` tag as bold.

Note: The `<strong>` tag should not be used to stylistically bold text.

### Example:
```
<body>
  <p>
    <strong> This </strong> is important.
  </p>
</body>
```
