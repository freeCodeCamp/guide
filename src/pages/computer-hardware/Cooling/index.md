# Cooling Systems #
Your computer contains many parts that generate heat.  Heat is generally bad for electronics parts and can cause premature failure and erratic behaviors.  The more you overclock the graphics or the CPU, the hotter the computer will run.  Modern Motherboards have thermal monitoring and shutdown a computer to prevent overheating, but this is a disruptive solution and should be a last ditch effort to save your computer from further heat damage.  Having a cooling stratety is a integral part of your hardware build and assures that you can use your computer as you wish and hopefully extend the life of your investment.

## Case Cooling ##
Case cooling can be a combination of a well ventilated case and the use of fans to circulate air within the case.  Most cases come with at least one fan.  This should be considered the minimum configuration.  It is recommended that there be at least two fans setup as an intake at one end and exhaust at the other so that cool air is drawn in and hot air is expelled.  There are many different types of fans and configurations.

## Components Cooling ##
Cooling can also be applied to indivudial parts on the computer.  The two most common are coolers for CPU's and graphics cards.  Component coolers should be used in conjuction with case cooling for maximum effect. There are generally two types of component cooling systems, active and passive.

* Passive Systems - usually comprised of a heat sink or some sort of heat conductive metal that is attached to the component.  The function of passive cooling is that by providing a larger surgace to absord the heat, one is also providing a larger surface to dissipate the heat.
* Active Systems - Adds a fan to the heat sink and when coupled with fan spped control on the motherboard, the cooling can be dynamically adjusted to the speed of the CPU and the heat that is generated inside the case.
* Liquid Cooling - High performance computers will benefit from a liquid cooled system.  Much like a radiator on a vehicle, a liquid is circulated between the heat sink and a cooling radiator mounted away from all the heat

## Environmental Considerations ##
* Keep it clean - Dust can clog up fans, heat sinks and act an an insulating layer trapping heat.  Use compressed air to keep the dust out of the internal cavity.
* Case Covers - Contrary to what you read on the internet, keeping the case covers on the computer aids cooling.  When you remove a cover you introduce a big zone of either positive or negative air pressure disrupting the normal flow of air across the components.
* Room ventilation - While having the computer next to a cooling duct is a good thing, having it next to a heating duct or in a hot spot in the room will only making cooling the computer difficut.  Locate the computer where it is neutral to the rooms enviromental registers.
* Rooms placement - locate the computer aways from windows or areas of strong sunlight exposure.  Placement in closets can also provide challanges to cooling.  
* Give it room to breathe - Locating the computer away from other computer and electronic equipment allows it to manage its own heat and not the heat of other electronics in the same shelf or area.
