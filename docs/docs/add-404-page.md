title: "Add 404 Page"
---

Adding a 404 page is easy. Simply create a page that matches `/404*`. Most
often you'll just want to create a React component page at `pages/404.js`.

Gatsby ensures that your 404 page is outputted as `404.html` as many static
hosting platforms default to using this as your 404 error page. If you're
hosting your site another way, you'll need to setup a custom rule to serve
this file for 404 errors.

When developing, Gatsby adds a default 404 page that overrides your custom
404 page. But you can still visit the exact url for your 404 page to verify
it's working as expected.
