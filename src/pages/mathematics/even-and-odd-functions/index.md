My Changes:-
A function is a relation that uniquely associates members of one set with members of another set.
e.g. Here, Addition of 2 numbers is denoted as f(x,y) = x + y.
f(2,3) = 5.
ODD FUNCTION : If f is a function and f(-x) = -f(x)
EVEN fUNCTION : IF f is a function and f(-x) = f(x)

e.g. The cube of a number is an odd function. Let's see that with an example.
Let x = 2
Hence, f(x) = f(2) = 8, f(-x) = f(-2) = -8 = -f(x) i.e f(-x) = -f(x)
Geometrically, odd functions are symmetric about the origin
sin(x),sinh(x), x^3 are popular examples of odd functions.

e.g The square of a number is an even function. Let's see that with an example.
Let x = 4
Hence, f(x) = f(4) = 16, f(-x) = f(-4) = 16 = f(x) i.e. f(-x) = f(x)
Geometrically, even functions are symmetric about Y-axis.
cos(x),cosh(x), x^2 are popular exams of even functiond=s,
