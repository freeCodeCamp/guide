## Comments in HTML

The comment tag is an element used to leave notes, mostly related to the project or the website. This tag is frequently used to explain something in the code or leave some recommendations about the project. The comment tag also makes it easier for the developer to come back and understand the code he's written at a later stage.

It is good practice to add comments to your code, especially when working with a team or at a company.  This helps future developers or fellow teammates know what is going on more easily when they look at your code.  

### Example
```html

<!-- You can comment out a large number of lines like this.
Author: xyz
Date: xx/xx/xxxx
Purpose: abc
-->
