## CSS Images

CSS Images is a module of CSS that defines what types of images can be used (the <image> type, containing URLs, gradients and other types of images), how to resize them and how they, and other replaced content, interact with the different layout models.

Images can be used with numerous CSS properties, such as background-image, border-image, content, list-style-image, and cursor." href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image"><code>&lt;image&gt;</code></a>
