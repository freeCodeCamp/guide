## Footer Tag

The `<footer></footer>` tag is new to HTML5. It acts as a container for the likes of copyright, authorship and contact information, for back to top links and other related documents.
Note: If you wish to add contact information inside a `<footer></footer>` element then it should be contained inside an `<address></address>` tag.
