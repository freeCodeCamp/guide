## HTML Entities

The main application of entities is to replace reserved HTML characters. In addition, they are used to enter characters that do not exist on the keyboard.

### Using reserved characters

The character '<' (less than), for example, is used in the composition of html tags. To enter its equivalent literal, we use the entity **`&lt;`** (or **`&#60;`**). In the same way, we use **`&gt;`** (or **`&#62;`**) to represent the literal '>' (greater than).

### Sticking words together

A very common entity used in html is the non-breaking space entity: **`&nbsp;`**. It is useful when the words must not be separated, as in **5 AM**, **15 mph**, **art. 20**, etc.

### Extending the keyboard

The entities are also used to insert characters that do not exist on the keyboard, as the copyright Â© character, easily replaced by the entity **`&copy;`**.
