---
Python is known for its beautiful syntax and ease of readability. This scripting language can be used for some quick-and-dirty prototyping of your idea of a web-app. It can also be used to build scalable and maintainable large web applications.

So let's get started with some web frameworks and learn how they help build web app on-hands. But before that, we would need to set-up the development environment by completing <a href='http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/setting-up-python-web-framework-django-and-flask/19354' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>installation of web frameworks in Python</a>.

Some interesting and well docmuented web frameworks to start with are e.g.:
* <a href='http://flask.pocoo.org' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Flask</a> and the underlying <a href='http://flask.pocoo.org' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Werkzeug</a> (Python 2.6+, Python 3.3+)
* <a href='https://www.djangoproject.com' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Django</a> (Python 2.6.5+, Python 3.2+)
* <a href='http://turbogears.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Turbo Gears</a> (Python 2.6+ Python 3.2+)
