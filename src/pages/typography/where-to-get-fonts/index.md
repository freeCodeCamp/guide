Online font services like Google Fonts provide an easy way to use different fonts on your site without the need to worry about whether or not the person viewing your site will have the font available on their system. To use Google Fonts in your site, visit the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> archive. You can browse the site to find the font that works best for your project. Once you've chosen, click the plus sign next to the font. A bar will appear at the bottom of the screen. Click on it. You will then be given several lines of code. Copy and paste the line of HTML into the head of your HTML file above the existing <link> element. Then take the CSS and use it where necessary in your stylesheet. 

Alternatively, you can either download TrueType or OpenType fonts from DaFont or 1001 Free Fonts and link them to your stylesheets
You're done! You successfully have new fonts for your site.
