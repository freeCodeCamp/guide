# API specification

Gatsby's APIs are tailored conceptually to some extent after React.js which
makes sense as users of Gatsby will necessarily also be users of React.js. I
think there's a lot of wins to making Gatsby feel as familiar as possible as
that'll ease adoption.

The two top priorities of the API are a) enable a broad and robust plugin
ecosystem and b) on top of that a broad and robust theme ecosystem (themes
are on the back burner btw until after v1 comes out).

## Plugins

Plugins can extend Gatsby in many ways:

* Sourcing data (e.g from the filesystem or an API or a database)
* Transforming data from one type to another (e.g. a markdown file to HTML)
* Creating pages (e.g. a directory of markdown files all gets turned into
* pages with URLs derived from their file names).  Modifying webpack config
* (e.g. for styling options, adding support for other compile-to-js
* languages) Adding things to the rendered HTML (e.g. meta tags, analytics JS
* snippits like Google Analytics) Writing out things to build directory based
* on site data (e.g. service worker, sitemap, RSS feed)

A single plugin can use multiple APIs to accomplish its purpose. E.g. the
plugin for the css-in-js library [Glamor
](/docs/packages/gatsby-plugin-glamor/)

1. modifies the webpack config to add its plugin
2. adds a Babel plugin to replace React's default createElement
3. modifies server rendering to extract
out the critical CSS for each rendered page and inline the CSS in the
`<head>` of that HTML page.

Plugins can also depend on other plugins.
[The Sharp plugin](/docs/packages/gatsby-plugin-sharp/)
exposes a number of high-level APIs for transforming images that several
other Gatsby image plugins depend on.
[gatsby-transformer-remark](/docs/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/)
does basic markdown->html transformation but exposes an API to allow other
plugins to intervene in the conversion process e.g.
[gatsby-remark-prismjs](/docs/packages/gatsby-remark-prismjs/)
which adds highlighting to code blocks.

Transformer plugins are decoupled from source plugins. Transformer plugins
simply look at the media type of new nodes created by source plugins to
decide if they can transform it or not. Which means that a markdown
transformer plugin can easily transform markdown from any source without any
other configuration e.g. from file, a code comment, or external service like
Trello which supports markdown in some of its data fields.

See [the full list of (official only for now — adding support for community
plugins later) plugins](/docs/plugins/). 

# API

## Concepts


* *Page* — a site page with a pathname, a template component, and optional graphql query and layout component
* *Layout Component* — surrounds a page and (eventually) can optionally have a parent layout component as well as a graphql query
* *Template Component* — responsible for rendering N pages. Can optionally have a graphql query
* *Component extensions* — extensions that are resolvable as components. `.js` and `.jsx` are supported by core. But plugins can add support for other compile-to-js languages.
* *Dependency* — Gatsby tracks automatically dependencies between different objects e.g. a page can depend on certain nodes. This allows for hot reloading, caching, incremental rebuilds, etc.
* *Node* — a data object
* *Node Field* — a field added by a plugin to a node that it doesn't control
* *Node Link* — a connection between nodes that gets converted to GraphQL relationships (is there a name for this?). Can be created in a variety of ways as well as automatically inferred. Parent/child links from nodes and their transformed derivative nodes are first class links.

## Operators

* *Create* — make a new thing
* *Get* — get an existing thing
* *Delete* — remove an existing thing
* *Replace* — replace an existing thing
* *Set* — merge into an existing thing

## Extension APIs

Gatsby has multiple processes. The most prominent is the "bootstrap" process.
It has several subprocesses. One tricky part to their design is that they run
both once during the initial bootstrap but also stay alive during development
to continue to respond to changes. This is what drives hot reloading that all
Gatsby data is "alive" and reacts to changes in the environment.

The bootstrap process is as follows:

load site config -> load plugins -> source nodes -> transform nodes -> create
graphql schema -> create pages -> compile component queries -> run queries ->
fin

Once the initial bootstrap is finished, for the development server we start
`webpack-dev-server` and a simple express server for serving files and for a
production build, we start building the css then javascript then HTML with
webpack.

During these processes there are various extension points where plugins can
intervene. All major processes have a `onPre` and `onPost` e.g.
`onPreBootstrap` and `onPostBootstrap` or `onPreBuild` or `onPostBuild`.
During bootstrap, plugins can respond at various stages to APIs like
`onCreatePages`, `onCreateBabelConfig`, and `onSourceNodes`.

At each extension point, Gatsby identifies the plugins which implement the
API and calls them in serial following their order in the site's
`gatsby-config.js`.

In addition to extension APIs in node, plugins can also implement extension
APIs in the server rendering process and the browser e.g. `onClientEntry` or
`onRouteUpdate`

The three main inspirations for this API and spec are React.js' API
specifically @leebyron's email on the React API
(https://gist.github.com/vjeux/f2b015d230cc1ab18ed1df30550495ed), this talk
"How to Design a Good API and Why it Matters" by Joshua Bloch who designed
many parts of Java. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heh4OeB9A-c&app=desktop,
and [Hapi.js](https://hapijs.com/api)' plugin design.
