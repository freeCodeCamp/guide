## Symbols

HTML character references are short bits of HTML, commonly referred to as character entities or entity codes, that are used to display characters that have special meaning in HTML as well as characters that don’t appear on your keyboard.

HTML symbols like mathematical operators, arrows, technical symbols and shapes, are not present on a normal keyboard.
Example:
`<p>I will display &euro;</p>`  We will see ` I will display €`

A complete list of all HTML character references is maintained by the [World Wide Web Consortium](http://w3c.github.io/html/syntax.html#named-character-references) as part of the HTML specification.
