## Ruby

Ruby is a programming language. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative.

For the purpose of drawing an analogy, writing a program in a loosely typed language such as Ruby can be compared to sketching with a pencil - easy to change, low fidelity, fast and easy. In contrast, writing in a strongly typed language such as C++ can be compared to painting with acrylic. It requires planning and time dedication, and cannot be done as easily. 

Many developers and start-ups enjoy using Ruby because of how quickly it can be written. It is the high level scripting language that powers Ruby on Rails, which remains one of the more popular web development frameworks.
