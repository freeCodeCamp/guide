## Section

The HTML ```<section>``` element defines a section within an HTML page that is used when there is not a more specific semantic HTML element to represent it. Typically, a ```<section>``` element will include a heading element (```<h1>``` - ```<h6>```) as child element. 

For example, a web page could be divided into various sections such as welcome, content and contact sections. 

A ```<section>``` element should not be used in place of a ```<div>``` element if a generic container is needed. It should be used to define sections within an HTML page.

```html
<section>
  <h2>This is a Heading</h2>
  <p>This is a paragraph of content</p>
</section>
```
