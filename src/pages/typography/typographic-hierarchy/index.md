## Typographic Hierarchy

There are a few basic methods for establishing a visual typographic hierarchy:

Size
Weight
Color

Most commonly these methods are used in combination with each other. In the concert list shown earlier, size, color, spacing, and type contrast were all used. The combinations are literally endless.

## Size
This is the easiest and most common method for establishing hierarchy.


## Weight
Simply using a bolder weight of a font can help isolate.

## Color
Color plays a big role in what our eye sees as primary and secondary. Generally speaking; warm colors pop, cooler colors recede.

Position
Where sections of information are positioned in relationship to each other can establish a hierarchy.

Contrasting Typefaces
A great way to achieve hierarchy is to use contrasting typefaces.
