## HTML5 Semantic Elements

Semantics add meaning to content by using specific languages and syntaxes. The HTML5 Semantic Elements allow you to control the organization and display of your content. This is important in ensuring functionality and ease of access to your page content. 

Some of the most common Semantic Elements on HTML5 are: 

<b>Nav</b> is a section with navigation links that links to other pages or parts within the webpage.  This is primarily intended for sections that consists of major navigation blocks.

<b>Article</b> represents a complete self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site. Nested articles need to be related to the main article. 

<b>Section</b> is a generic part of a document or application. 

<b>Aside</b> is also known as the Sidebar. A section of a page that is filled with content that are related. This can also be used for typographical effects like pull quotes or sidebars, for advertising, for groups of nav elements, and for other content that is considered separate from the main page. 

<b>div</b> is a powerful option for structuring content. This is an anonymous grouping element that can be used with the class, language, and title attributes to mark up semantic comments to a group of consecutive elements.
