## Sprint Planning Meetings

Sprint is a time frame with selected tasks and a preset time period (usually from 2 to 4 weeks). During sprint, team members accomplish their sets of tasks, assigned during sprint planning meetings. Sprint planning meeting is a special meeting of both project managers, team leaders and all of the team members in order to figure out what, how and when should be done during the upcoming sprint. They are held in the beginning of a sprint. Usually you estimate how long would it take to finish certain tasks and how much effort you will need to do that.

During sprint planning meeting people share their thoughts about different aspects of the ongoing development process and may even propose desired changes for it. These meetings are needed to estimate and plan further actions for the sprint.
