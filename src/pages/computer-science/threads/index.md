## Threads

Thread is a sequence of instructions that can be run independently by the operating system. It is mainly used when there are several tasks that need to be run parallely, with each task not hindering the work of another.

Main difference between a Thread and Process are:

### Process:
- Processes are heavyweight.
- Process have it's own address space.
- higher overhead in communcation between processes.
- Context switching is slower.

### Threads: 
- Threads are lightweight.
- Threads share their address space.
- Lighter overhead in inter-thread communication.
- Context switching is faster.
