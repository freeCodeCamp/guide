title: Bayes Classifier

Bayes Classifier is based on applying Bayes Theorem to update its belief on the probability of an event occurring. 

![Bayes Theorem](https://github.com/Cheungo/bayes_theorem_image/blob/master/CodeCogsEqn.gif?raw=true)

Bayes Theorem allows you to compute the probability of B given A, provided you have probabilities for A given B, A, and B.

Bayes Classifier models uncertainty by keeping probabilities for each of the possible scenarios. As more information becomes available, the probabilities are updated to more accurately reflect what is now known about the given situation.
