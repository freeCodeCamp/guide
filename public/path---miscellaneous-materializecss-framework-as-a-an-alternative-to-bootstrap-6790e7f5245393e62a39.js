Expanding upon the “card” motifs that debuted in Google Now, Material Design makes more liberal use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.</p>\n<p>This <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8TXgCzxEnw' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>video</a> gives you an idea about material design:</p>\n<h2>Check out this websites that are using Materialize, See the difference to what you’re used to!</h2>\n<p>Test them on your phone too for a better feel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href='https://www.100xp.io/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>The 100</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href='http://demo.geekslabs.com/materialize/v2.1/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Admin Themes</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href='http://www.straphq.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>StrapHq</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More examples <a href='http://materializecss.com/showcase.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>here</a></p>\n<h2>A bootstrap alternative, really?</h2>\n<p>Chill, nothing can ever beat bootstrap, imo. However, materialize CSS offers just that, Materializ-ation - The feeling of interacting with the interface as if its a physical material, like paper. I just came up with that.</p>\n<p>But really…</p>\n<p>I do like materialize because of its simplicity, for example;</p>\n<p>In bootstrap you would do this to a button</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code><button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg\">\nMy Button\n</button></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Basically each class name repeatedly has the btn- attached to it. And this is mostly the case for many other bootstrap components especially when you want to add simple classes like color.</p>\n<p>With Materialize you can add all the classes simply like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code><button class=\"btn waves-effect waves-light green\">My Button</a></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>As you can see, use of the btn- has been reduced. The <code>green</code> class can be re-used with any/all other HTML element other than the <code>button</code> shown in this case.</p>\n<p>There is another lighter version of material Design Framework but its not as elegant or simple as the materializeCSS framework Other than this simplicity, here are more reasons why I love materializeCSS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s simple! — Just emphasizing</li>\n<li>It’s open-source, you can git it here</li>\n<li>A community is also growing around it</li>\n<li><a href='http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Someone</a> is looking to produce a blend of Bootstrap + Materialize. Sweeet!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Anything else?</h2>\n<p>Try it out and maybe you will love it. In fact since thats where even android UI is already headed, this might a good way to get yourself better at Material design for mobile-focused web-apps like <a href='https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/your-first-progressive-web-app/#what-will-you-learn' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>progressive web apps</a></p>\n<h3>Maybe you shouldn’t use it …yet</h3>\n<p>It’s undergoing changes being at alpha stage. So you might skip it and not use it on crucial project until it matures.</p>",fields:{slug:"/miscellaneous/materializecss-framework-as-a-an-alternative-to-bootstrap/"},frontmatter:{title:"Materializecss Framework as a an Alternative to Bootstrap"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/miscellaneous/materializecss-framework-as-a-an-alternative-to-bootstrap/"}}}});
