## Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted. Scrum Masters do this by ensuring that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices, and rules.

The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which arenâ€™t. The Scrum Master helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value created by the Scrum Team.

### Scrum Master's Job

- Facilitating (not participating in) the daily standup
- Helping the team maintain their burndown chart
- Setting up retrospectives, sprint reviews or sprint planning sessions
- Shielding the team from interruptions during the sprint
- Removing obstacles that affect the team
- Walking the product owner through more technical user stories
- Encouraging collaboration between the Scrum team and product owner

Scrum masters are part of an Agile team. They can be developers or other functional members (wearing multiple hats) or functioning individually as a sole role in a team. Their main objective is to enhance the development using the Scrum framework.

Often their role is to: guide the sprint planning, monitor daily standup, conduct retrospectives, ensure velocity is present, help Scoping of Sprints.
