## Vim Navigation

### Basic movement

There are many ways to move the cursor in Vim, but these basic movements will allow
new users to get comfortable using normal mode for file navigation. 

* In normal mode, the keys `h`, `j`, `k` , `l` correspond to moving the cursor
one character left, down, up, and right, respectively. 

* To navigate one word at a time, the keys `w`, and `b` will move the cursor to
the beginning of the next word, or the beginning of the previous word. The `e`
key will move the cursor to the end of the current word.

* To move to the beginning of the current line, type `0`, and to move to the end
of the current line, type `$`.

* Finally, to move to the first line in the file, type `gg`, and to move to the
last line in the file, type `G`.

In summary:
