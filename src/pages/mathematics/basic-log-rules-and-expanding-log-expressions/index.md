## Basic Log Rules and Expanding Log Expressions

Logarithms are just a convenient and faster way of doing complex calculations. They are the inverse function to exponentiation. The basic log rules are :

1. log(a ^ k) = k * log(a)
2. log(a * b) = log(a) + log(b)
3. log(a / b) = log(a) - log(b)
4. log(1) = 0
