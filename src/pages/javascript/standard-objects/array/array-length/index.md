## Array Length

`length` is a property of arrays in JavaScript that returns or sets the number of elements in a given array.

The `length` property of an array can be returned like so.

```js
let desserts = ["Cake", "Pie", "Brownies"];
console.log(desserts.length); // 3
```
The assignment operator, in conjunction with the `length` property, can be used to set then number of elements in an array like so.

```js
let cars = ["Saab", "BMW", "Volvo"];
cars.length = 2;
console.log(cars.length); // 2
```
