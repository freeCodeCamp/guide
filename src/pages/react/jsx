Alt- JSX
======

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was written to be used with React. JSX code looks a lot like HTML.

What does "syntax extension" mean? In this case, it means that JSX is not valid JavaScript. Web browsers can't read it! If 
a JavaScript file contains JSX code, then that file will have to be compiled. That means that before the file reaches a 
web browser, a JSX compiler will translate any JSX into regular JavaScript.

A basic unit of JSX is called a JSX element. Here's an example of a JSX element:

```javascript
<h1>Hello world</h1>
```

This JSX element looks exactly like HTML! The only noticeable difference is that you would find it in a JavaScript file, 
instead of in an HTML file.
