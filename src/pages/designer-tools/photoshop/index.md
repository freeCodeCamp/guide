## Photoshop

Adobe Photoshop is a graphics editor developed by [Adobe Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Systems) for macOS(formerly OS X) and Windows. It is a raster graphics editor which means that the graphics produced by this program has a fixed resolution once exported and cannot be changed without affecting the quality of the graphics. It was created by [Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Knoll) and [John Knoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Knoll) in 1988.

Photoshop can edit and create raster images with multiple layers, effects and supports many color models like CMYK, RGB, CIELAB, spot color and duotone. Photoshop is able to open and edit a huge array of raster image formats like JPEG, PNG, BMP and it also has the limited ability to render and edit vector images like AI(Proprietary format for Adobe Illustrator), EPS, SVG etc. 

Photoshop originally used the numerical naming scheme until 2002 when it switched to the Creative Suite branding under which each new version of Photoshop was designated with "CS" plus a number(For example CS6, CS7 etc). This too changed in 2013 when it introduced the Creative Cloud branding which changed Photoshop's licensing scheme to that of software as a service rental model and the "CS" suffixes were replaced with "CC". The latest Photoshop version as of October 2017 is the **Photoshop CC 2018 (19.0.0)**.

Adobe also develops and publishes companion apps like Photoshop Elements, Photoshop Lightroom, Photoshop Express and Photoshop Touch along with the desktop version of the software for entry-level designers and for devices like mobiles and tablets(iOS and Android) respectively. Collectively these are known as "The Adobe Photoshop Family".

### File Format
Photoshop also has its own file format .PSD("Photoshop Document") which is the one it uses while saving the images edited using the same. The PSD format is also supported by other graphics and video editing software from Adobe Systems like Illustrator, After Effects and  Adobe Premiere Pro due to its popularity.

.PSB("Photoshop Big") is also used sometimes to store large images, it increases the maximum height and width of a supported image to 300,000 pixels and the length limit to around 4 Exabytes. This format is not used very often.

### Plugins
The functionality of Photoshop can be extended using many 3rd Party and 1st party plugins available on the market. Adobe Camera Raw is an example of a 1st party plugin created by Adobe to process RAW images from cameras. The various types of plugins that are available in the market are filters, export, import, selection, color correction, and automation. Filters are the most famous type of plugins.

### Tools
Upon opening an image in photoshop or creating a new blank image we are presented with a set of tools on the left-hand side of the screen. These are the Photoshop tools that a designer uses to edit and manipulate the image. The tools fall into mainly 6 categories.
* Drawing
* Painting 
* Measuring and Navigation 
* Selection 
* Typing 
* Retouching

Some tools contain a small triangle in the bottom right of the toolbox icon. Upon long pressing these, we get an expanded menu which contains similar tools.

Some of the main tools and their uses are given below.

#### Pen tool
The pen tool is used to create precise paths that can be manipulated using anchor points. There are 2 types of pen tool namely the free form pen tool and the magnetic pen tool. The free form pen tool allows the user to draw paths freehand using either a mouse or a graphics tablet. The magnetic pen tool is similar to the free form pen tool the difference being that the drawn path attaches closely to outlines of objects in an image, which is useful for isolating them from a background.

#### Brush Tool
The brush tool as the name suggests is used to draw and paint in Photoshop, unlike real-life brushes these do not have a fixed tip and it can emulate a huge variety of brush tips and also has support for more advanced features like varying the thickness of the stroke based on the pen pressure on a graphics tablet. Apart from drawing, the brush tool is also used in image manipulation also.

#### Clone Stamp Tool
The Clone Stamp tool copies one part of an image to another part of the same image by using a brush. You do this by selecting the source area of the image by holding the Ctrl(ALT on a Mac) and then using a brush tool to paint on the destination area of the image. You can also clone areas of one layer to another layer. This tool is used to duplicate objects or pattens and also to erase objects from a certain area.

#### Shape tools
Shape tools are tools used to create all sorts of polygons like squares, rectangles and even circles and spheres.

#### Eyedropper Tool
The eyedropper tool is used to pick colours from an image. Upon clicking an area in an image with the eyedropper tool it samples the area and saves the color in the "Swatches" area.

#### Crop tool
The crop tool is used to select an area of an image and discard the rest of the image. It is used to remove unwanted portions of the image and also to correct the 'framing' of the photograph.

#### Marquee and Lasso Tool
The marquee and lasso tools are tools used to make selections on the image either to edit the particular area of the image selectively or to resize or crop it. The Marquee tool allows selections that are single row, single column, rectangular and elliptical while the lasso tool allows custom freehand selection. The lasso tool is of three types – regular, polygonal, and magnetic.

#### Magic wand and Quick Selection Tool
The magic wand and the quick selection tool selects areas based on pixels of similar values. Clicking on an image with these tools will select all neighboring pixels with similar value within a tolerance level set by the user. The quick selection tool is generally considered superior due to the fact that it is more fine tunable when compared to the magic wand tool.

#### Eraser Tool
The Erasor tool as the name suggests erases the content of the curently selected layer in the document. The size and the style of the erasor can be set like the brush tool.  In addition to the normal eraser tool, there are two more types of erasors available – background eraser and magic eraser. The background erasor is used to extract objects from the background, it deletes any part of the image that is on the edge of an object. The magig erasor on the other hand works like the magic wand tool erasing pixels based on similar color.
