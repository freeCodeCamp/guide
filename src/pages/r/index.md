## What is R?
R is an open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is one of the primary languages used by data scientists and statisticians alike. R was initially written by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the Department of Statistics of the University of Auckland in New Zealand. The R language is partly based on the S language, and is built around the concept that it must allow users to add additional functionality by defining their own functions. By and large this can be done with the R language itself. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++, and even Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. 

R It is supported by the [R Foundation for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/) and a large community of open source developers which meets on a regular basis at [R Conferences](https://www.r-project.org/conferences.html). 

## Popular R Tools & Packages

* [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. 
* [The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/) is a leading source for R tools and resources. Source code for many top open-source R packages can be found there.
