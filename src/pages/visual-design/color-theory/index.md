## Color Theory

Color Theory is the practical application of mixing and using colors together to achieve a specific visual effect. This can be broken down further into segments describing where to find colors, how to use color, and how color can impact usability.  

A color wheel is the main tool used by designers to specify or locate color. Color wheels can include the entire color spectrum or they can be organized by a defined category of colors. 
The three main category of colors, which you might already be familiar with, are Primary Colors, Secondary Colors, and Tertiary Colors.

**Primary Colors:**
Red, yellow and blue
In traditional color theory primary colors are the 3 pigment colors that cannot be mixed or formed by any combination of other colors. All other colors are derived from these 3 hues. 

**Secondary Colors:**
Green, orange and purple
These are the colors formed by mixing the primary colors.

**Tertiary Colors:** 
Yellow-orange, red-orange, red-purple, blue-purple, blue-green & yellow-green
These are the colors formed by mixing a primary and a secondary color. 

In web design, colors also carry with them connotations and implications that need to be understood or else you could cause confusion. The color red in a non-digital space, such as a fast-food restaurant, carries the implication of energy or excitement. However, on the web the color red also carries with it the implication that the user has committed an error. This example of how color means certain things in certain settings should be a critical reminder to understand how the person viewing your page will interpret the color selection you’ve made.

The overall experience a person has when viewing your page is also determined by the color selection you’ve made. For example, using light-gray or yellow color text on a white background makes it very tough for most people to read. This is due to a lack of contrast between the colors. Black text on a white background or white text on a blue background conversely has high contrast and will be easier to read.

Individuals who are affected by color-blindness might not be able to differentiate between similar colors as easily as you either. What you perceive as a wonderful palette of greens and blues might appear gray, beige, and dull to someone else. Importantly, if you choose a text color that views well for you, it might have much lower contrast than you realize to someone else, making it harder to understand the content you are trying to display. 

### Colour Schemes

Colour schemes are colour combinations. Some of the more common colour schemes are:

**1. Monochromatic** 
  Monochrome is a single hue with a variety of similar tints and shades. For example: red, pink, peach, and white.

**2. Analogous** 
  Analogous colours are three hues that are next to each on the color wheel. For example: red, red-orange, and orange. 

**3. Complementary** 
  Complementary colours are two hues that are opposite each other on the color wheel. For example: red and green.

**4. Triadic** 
  Triadic colorurs are three colors that are equidistant from each other on the color wheel. For example: red, blue, and yellow.

### Hue, Value & Saturation

The [Munsell colour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munsell_color_system#/media/File:Munsell-system.svg) system defines colours in three dimentions: hue, value and saturation. Hue is the colour (eg. red, blue, yellow), Value refers to the relative lightness of a colour and Saturation, also known as Chroma, refers to the intensity of the colour.
