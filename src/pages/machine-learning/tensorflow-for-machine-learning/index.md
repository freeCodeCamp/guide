title: Machine Learning using Tensorflow

#### What is TensorFlow?
"TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library for research and production. TensorFlow offers APIs for beginners and experts to develop for desktop, mobile, web, and cloud."

Tensorflow allows users to create dataflow graphs. These are structures that describe how a data moves through a graph. These nodes are connected to each other, with nodes representing the mathematical operations and the connections representing the multi dimensional arrays or tensors.

Tensorflow allows developers to concentrate more on the logic of the application than getting stuck in the complex algorithms or figuring out the most optimal way to implement those algorithms. While creating a Deep Network, it can also become tedious to determine which node needs to be connected to which. Tensorflow makes it easier to make connections between the layers. Thus, it becomes easier for the developers to concentrate more on making the application better.
