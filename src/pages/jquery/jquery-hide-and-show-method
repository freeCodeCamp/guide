# jQuery Hide Method
The jQuery ```.hide()``` method is pretty simple.
To hide an element, use this syntax: 
```$(selector).hide(speed, callback);```
Both the speed and callback parameters are optional. 
The speed parameter specifices the speed of the hiding. It can take the values "slow", "fast", or a number of miliseconds.
The callback parameter is a function to be executed after the ```.hide()``` method completes.

# jQuery Show Method
The jQuery ```.show()``` method is also very simple.
To show a hidden element you would just do this:
```$(selector).show(speed, callback);```
Again, the speed and callback methods are optional. They do the same thing they did for the hide method.
