title: Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
---
In JavaScript, when the `+` operator is used with a String value, it is called the `concatenation` operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

## Example
```javascript
    'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
```
## Note

Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.
