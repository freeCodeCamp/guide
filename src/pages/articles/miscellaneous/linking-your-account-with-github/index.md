title: Linking Your Account with Github
---
In August 2015, we pushed some changes that caused trouble for many of our campers.

If you are unable to link your GitHub account to your current account, here is what we recommend doing:

1) Sign out with your current account and try signing in with GitHub.  
2) Check your challenge map. Your account should have no progress. Delete that account here: <a href='http://freecodecamp.com/account' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>http://freecodecamp.com/account</a>  
3) Sign into Free Code Camp the way you normally do (Facebook, email, etc). You should see your original progress.  
3) Now add GitHub to that account, and you should be all set.
