## Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings

* When you need to use a special character such as `"` inside a string you need to escape it using `\`.

## Solution
```javascript
var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\".";
var otherStr = 'I am a \'single quoted\' string inside \'single quotes\'.';
```
