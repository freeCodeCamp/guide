## Algorithms

An algorithm is like a recipe. It's a series of steps you take in order to achieve a specific outcome.

Some common types of algorithms include sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and compression algorithms.

A very important aspect to consider while evaluating an algorithm is to look at it its time complexity. This shows how the running time of the algorithm grows as the input size grows. Since the algorithms today, have to be operate on large data inputs, it is essential for our algorithms to have a reasonably fast running time .

freeCodeCamp's curriculum heavily emphasizes creating algorithms. This is because learning algorithms is a good way to practice programming skills. Interviewers most commonly test candidates on algorithms during developer job interviews.
