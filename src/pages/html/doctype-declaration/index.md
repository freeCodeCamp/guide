## Doctype Declaration
The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration identifies the language the webpage is written in. This declaration is not an HTML tag, but rather a notification to the browser that ensures the browser will display the page correctly.

The simplest doctype is `html`. This is the recommended doctype, indicating the webpage is written with HTML 5. Other valid doctypes include XHTML and older versions of HTML.

The doctype declaration must always appear first in your HTML documents, before anything else.

#### Example
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Document Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- The content of the document goes here. -->
  </body>
</html>
```
