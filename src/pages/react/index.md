## React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, created by [facebook](https://www.facebook.com "Facebook").

It's declarative: React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application. It's efficient: React computes the minimal set of changes necessary to keep your DOM up-to-date. And it's flexible: React works with the libraries and frameworks that you already know.

To describe component's DOM representations, React uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. A simple transform is included with React that allows converting JSX into native JavaScript for browsers to digest.

### What tools do I need for getting started in React?

React is just javascript, so all you need to get started is a text-editor and a browser and create a webpage with the React library embedded, but that method is for [dinosaurs](https://medium.com/@peterxjang/modern-javascript-explained-for-dinosaurs-f695e9747b70 "An interesting article about how Web Development evolved the last few years."). 

What you really need is:
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org "The node.js webpage.")
- A text-editor for coding, like [brackets](http://brackets.io/), [sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A browser (yay [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/ "The US page for downloading the Firefox Web Browser")

By using `node.js` you can make your development process mre fluid and your development environment more productive. Node.js comes with `npm`, the Node.js package manager, which can be used to use a huge multitude of javascript frameworks and libraries.
