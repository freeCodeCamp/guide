title: Warn Your Users of a Dangerous Action with Btn Danger
---
The `btn-danger` class is the button color you'll use to notify users that the button performs a destructive action, such as deleting a cat photo. Note that these buttons still need the `btn` and `btn-block` classes.

    <button class="btn btn-block btn-danger">Delete</button>
