Processing and saving user input from form data

Hello World in php

<?php
  echo "Hello World!";
?>

Code Description

This is as basic as PHP gets. Three simple lines, the first line identifies that everything beyond the <?php tag, until the ?> tag, is PHP code. The second line causes the greeting to be printed (or echoed) to the web page. This next example is slightly more complex and uses variables.
