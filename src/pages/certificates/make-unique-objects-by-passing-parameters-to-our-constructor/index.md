title: Make Unique Objects by Passing Parameters to Our function Object() { [native code] }
---
When you have a constructor but don't want to keep creating the same object, all you have to do is add parameters to the constructor the following way:

    var Car = function(wheels, seats, engines) {

      this.wheels = wheels;

      this.seats = seats;

      this.engines = engines;

    };

Now you can pass in arguments when you call the constructor. `var myCar = new Car(6, 3, 1);`

This will result in:

    {

      wheels: 6,

      seats: 3,

      engines: 1

    }
