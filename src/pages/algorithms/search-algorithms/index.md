## Search Algorithms
In computer science, a search algorithm is any algorithm which solves the Search problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure or calculated in the search space of a problem domain. Examples of such structures include Linked Lists, Array data structures, Search trees and many more. The appropriate search algorithm often depends on the data structure being searched but also on prior knowledge about the data.

This kind of algorithm looks at the problem of re-arranging an array of items in asceding order. The two most clasical examples of that is the binary search and the merge sort algorithm.
