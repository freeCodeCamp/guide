## jQuery

jQuery is the most widely-used JavaScript library, and is used in more than half of all major websites. 

jQuery makes web development easier easier to use by providing a number of helper functions. These help developers quickly write DOM interactions without needing to manually writing as much JavaScript themselves.
jQuery is a library of helper functions that are cross browser–compatible.The amount of browser-specific code we  must write can be minimized by using jQuery, an open-source add-in that provides an easy, browser-agnostic means for writing JavaScript.
 jQuery is written in JavaScript, so it is JavaScript.It’s easy to use, it’s stable, it’s fully documented, and it works well with other frameworks. The following is a list of the categories of functionality jQuery provides.
 
***Ajax:*** Methods that provide synchronous and asynchronous calls to the server.

***Attributes:*** Methods that get and set attributes of document object model (DOM) elements. 

***Callbacks object:*** An object that provides many methods for managing callbacks.

***Core:*** Methods that provide core jQuery functionality.

***CSS:*** Methods that get and set CSS-related properties.

***Data:*** Methods that assist with associating arbitrary data with DOM elements.

***Deferred object:*** A chainable object that can register multiple callbacks into callback queues and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or asynchronous functions.

***Dimensions:*** Helper methods for retrieving and setting DOM element dimensions.

***Effects:*** Animation techniques that can be added to your webpage.

***Events:*** Methods that provide the ability to register code to execute when the user interacts with the browser.

***Forms:*** Methods that provide functionality when working with form controls.

***Offset:*** Methods for positioning DOM elements.
