## Retrospectives

The Sprint Retrospective can really be the most useful and important of the scrum ceremonies. 

The concept of *"Inspect and Adapt"* is crucial to creating a successful and thriving team. 
The standard agenda for the retrospective is 
* What do we keep doing?
* What do we stop doing?
* What do we start doing?

And from this discussion, the team creates a list of behaviors that they work on, collectively, over time.

Invite the scrum team only to the Retrospective. (Delivery Team, Product Owner, Scrum Master). Discourage managers, stakeholders, business partners, etc. They are a distraction and can hinder the sense of openness the team needs.
