## Comparison with the strict equality operator


### Problem explanation:
Â· _Use the strict equality operator in the `if` statement so the function will return "Equal" when `val` is strictly equal to `7`._

#### Hint 1
Remember from last exercise that _equality is different from assignment (`=`), which assigns the value at the right of the operator to a variable in the left._<sup><a href="#cite1">1</a></sup>

> 
#### Hint 2
_Unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion._<sup><a href="#cite2">2</a></sup>

## Spoiler alert!

**Solution ahead!**

## Basic code solution:

```javascript

// Setup
function testStrict(val) {
  if (val === 7) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not equal";
}

// Change this value to test
testStrict(10);

```

### Code explanation
The function first evaluates `if` the condition `(val === 7)` evaluates to `true`. If it does, it returns the statement between the curly braces ("Equal"). If it doesn't, it returns the next `return` statement outside them ("Not equal").
