## Id Selector

An ID selector in CSS is used to apply styles to an element with a specific id. It works the same way that a class selector, only while more than one element can have the same class, only one element can have the same id. Ids are represented in CSS with a hashtag.

For the following HTML:

```html
<p id="intro">My name is Inigo Montoya</p>
```
We would use the following CSS to style it:

```css
#intro{
  color: white;
  background: blue;
  padding: 10px;
}
```
