# If statement in Go

For the flow control in Go the `if` statement is a common choice. `If` statements are used to make the execution of a certain section of the program depending on a condition. If that condition is evalueted to TRUE the section will be executed, if FALSE it will be skipped.



    ```go
    if <that is to be evaluated and must be boolean then> {
        //code that will be ececuted if the condition is 'true'
    }
    ```
