title: Create An Ordered List
---
HTML has a special element for creating ordered lists, or numbered-style lists.

Ordered lists start with a `<ol>` element. Then they contain some number of `<li>` elements.

For example:

    <ol>
      <li>hydrogen</li>
      <li>helium</li>
    </ol>

would create a numbered list of "hydrogen" and "helium".
