## Access Array Data with Indexes

The first element of an array is at position zero. So, if you want to access the first element of an array, you can do it like so:

```javascript
var arr = ["Programming", 123, "Coding", 789];

var firstElem = arr[0] // This is "Programming"
var thirdElem = arr[2] // This is "Coding"
var fourthElem = arr[3] // This is 789
```

Notice that the length of the array is 4, and the position of the last element of the array is 3.
