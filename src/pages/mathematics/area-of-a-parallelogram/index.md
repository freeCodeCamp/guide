## Area of a Parallelogram

A parallelogram is a [quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral) with two pairs of [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry) sides. A parallelogram's opposite sides and opposite angles are equal in measure.

To calculate the area of a parallelogram, you multiply its base times its perpendicular height. Any side can be the base, and then the perpendicular height extends from the base at a 90Â° angle to the parallel side.

Area (A) = base (b) x height (h)

You may notice that the formula for calculating the area of a parallelogram is the same as for calculating the area of a rectangle. This is because a parallelogram can be divided into a [trapezoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoid) and a [right triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle) and rearranged into a rectangle.

If you know the area of the parallelogram and either the base or height, you can find the missing element by dividing the area by the element you do know:

b = A / h

h = A / b

The above parallelogram has a 7cm base and a perpendicular height of 3cm. Therefore, the area of this parallelogram is 21cm (because 7cm x 3cm = 21cm).
