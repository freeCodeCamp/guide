## Voice

### Alexa

Alexa is Amazon’s cloud-based voice service available on tens of millions of devices from Amazon and third-party device manufacturers. With Alexa, you can build natural voice experiences that offer customers a more intuitive way to interact with the technology they use every day.
It is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, sports, and other real-time information, such as news.

# Far Field Microphones
Speech recognition systems often use multiple microphones to reduce the impact of reverberation and noise. 
The Echo mics are arranged in a hexagonal layout, with one microphone at each vertex and one in the center. The delay between each microphone receiving the signal enables the device to identify the source of the voice and cancel out noise coming from other directions. This is a phenomenon known as beamforming.

While state-of-the-art speech recognition systems perform reasonably well in close-talking microphone conditions, performance degrades in conditions where the microphone is far from the user.

The audio captured by the Echo will be influenced by:
1) the speaker’s voice against the wall of the room,
2) the background noise from outside, 
3) the acoustic echo coming from the device’s loudspeaker 
4) the output audio against the wall of the room.

# Software
The software components within the platform include both Natural Language Understanding (NLU) as well as Automated Speech Recognition (ASR).  These software components can be leveraged by custom written "skills" by independent software developers that are then certified to a set of standards by Amazon. There are already more than 20k of these custom skills available through their app store.
