## Value Stream Mapping

**Value stream mapping** is a lean software development technique. It helps to identity the waste in resources in terms of material, effort, cost and time.  

Calculating the process cycle efficiency is one of the ways to find out the efficiency of the AS-IS process.

**Process cycle efficiency = Value-added time spent / total cycle time.**   

The higher the value the better the efficiency.
