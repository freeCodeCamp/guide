## Signal

Signal is a communications app which aims to be both usable and secure. There is currently <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/wikileaks-cia-hack-signal-encrypted-chat-apps/">no indication</a> that Signal cryptography can be cracked by intelligence agencies. Signal is also reasonably secure <a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/eastern-virginia-grand-jury/">against subpoenas</a> from American law enforcement, since they keep minimal metadata.

Signal uses the Internet to send one-to-one and group messages, which can include files, voice notes, images and videos, anonymized GIF's, and make one-to-one voice and video calls. Signal also has a disappearing messages feature, enabling you to send ephemeral sensitive messages and media.

Signal uses standard cellular mobile numbers as identifiers, and uses end-to-end encryption to secure all communications to other Signal users.

Signal is developed by Open Whisper Systems. The clients are published as free and open-source software under the GPLv3 license. The server code is published under the AGPLv3 license.
