## Gatsby.js

Gatsby is a static site generator for [React](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/react), powered by [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). 

The Gatsby environment provides several "starters" to help configure static sites quickly. Starters can be found here: [Starter Library](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/).

### Installation and using the Gatsby CLI

* Node: `npm install --global gatsby-cli`
* Get started with the official Gatsby starter: `gatsby new gatsby-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default`
* After that change to the newly created directory `cd gatsby-site`
* `gatsby develop` starts a hot-reloading development server. The site will reload when changes in `src/pages` will be saved.
* To generate the static HTML pages use `gatsby build`
* `gatsby serve` will start a local server that will present your built site.
