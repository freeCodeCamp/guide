Temperature is the degree of hotness of coldness of a body ona definite scale. Although, the SI Unit of temperature is Kelvin denoted by K. Celsius and Fahrenheit are used more in day-to-day life.
0 degree Celsius = 273.15 K

The Conversion of Celsius to Fahrenheit is F = (9/5)*C + 32.
Given a temperature in Celsius units, just substitute the given value and solve the equation for F. e.g. The normal human body temperature is 37 degree Celsius.
Temperature in Fahrenheit = (9/5)*C + 32
                          = (9/5)*37 + 32
                          = 66.6 + 32
                          = 98.6
 Thus, the human body temperature is 98.6 degree Fahrenheit.
 Using the above equation, and given any of the values you can change the unir of temperature.
