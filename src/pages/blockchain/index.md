## Blockchain

> "Is a decentralized database that stores a registry of assets and transactions across a peer-to-peer network. Is basically a public registry of who owns what and who transacts what. The transactions are secured by cryptography, and over time, that transaction history gets locked in blocks of data that are then cryptographically linked together and secured. This creates an immutable, unforgeable record of all the transactions across this network. This record is replicated on every computer that uses the network."

Blockchain is often associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but they are not the same thing. Blockchain is the structure where Bitcoin runs on, and besides cryptocurrencies, it can be applied in many other fields like digital identity, supply chain and even [democracy](https://www.democracy.earth/).

Even though blockchain can be applied to a big range of problems, is not the solution to everything. This technology is usually used  to solve problems where the parts don't trust each other.

A third party is usually needed to validate trust relationships. In the most common example, which is the banking system, a trusted authority is needed, such as a bank, to intermediate transactions, manage accounts, verify balances, and validate transfers. Blockchain then, comes in this case to replace the regulatory authority. In the case of cryptocurrencies, it replaces the figure of the bank, doing all the validations and guaranteeing the security and veracity in the transactions.

For this reason Blockchain is also known as **"The Trust Protocol"**.
