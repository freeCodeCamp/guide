<h3>1. Notebook document</h3>
Notebook documents are documents produced by the Jupyter Notebook App, which contain both computer code and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etc...). Notebooks are easy to read documents and code executables, which can be of great help presenting your solution, since you can share your code, trends and insights in one document. It is more convenient for a developer than standard slides in PowerPoint.

<h3>2. Jupyter Notebook App</h3>
The Jupyter Notebook App is a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser. You can execute the app on your local desktop without internet access or install it on a remote server and access through the internet. Control panel of the app allows user to open documents and shut down kernels.

<h3>3. Kernels</h3>
A notebook kernel is a “computational engine” that executes the code contained in a Notebook document. There are kernels for different languages: IPython for Python, IRkernel for R and IJulia for Julia. The app automatically launches the associated kernel, when user opens a notebook. When the notebook is executed, the kernel performs the computation and produces the results.

<h3>4. Notebook Dashboard</h3>
The Notebook Dashboard is the component which you see first when launching Jupyter Notebook App. The Notebook Dashboard is mainly used to open notebook documents, and to manage the running kernels.

The Notebook Dashboard has other features similar to a file manager, namely navigating folders and renaming/deleting files.
