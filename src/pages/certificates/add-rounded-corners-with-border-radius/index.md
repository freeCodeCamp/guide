title: Add Rounded Corners With Border Radius
---
To make round corners it is all about `border-radius` and pixels.

You can specify a border-radius with pixels. This will affect how rounded the corners are.
```css
    .thick-green-border {
      border-color: green;
      border-width: 10px;
      border-style: solid;
      border-radius: 10px;
    }
```
