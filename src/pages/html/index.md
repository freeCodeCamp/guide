# HTML

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for describing the structure of websites. You could build a website using nothing but HTML if you wanted to.

[HTML elements](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/html/elements) are the syntax to mark up a page. They help organize and give information about the page's content to a browser. Elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, there are different tags to place around text to show whether it's a heading, a paragraph, or a list, for instance:

```html
<h1>This is a first level header (six evels of headings exist in HTML)</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph that has some <em>empathised</em> words.</p>

```

The HyperText part of HTML comes from the early days of the web. Pages usually contained static documents that connected to other documents with hypertext links.

HTML5 is the latest version, or specification, of HTML. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the organization responsible for developing standards for the World Wide Web, including those for HTML. As web pages and web applications grow more complex, W3C runs the process to update HTML's standards.
