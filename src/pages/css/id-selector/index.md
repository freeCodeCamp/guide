## Id Selector

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->

In CSS, the id selector styles a HTML element with the specified id. The id selector is preceded by a hash character (“#”). 

```css 
#unique-element {
	border-bottom: 1px solid grey;
}
```

The id selector of an HTML element should be unique within a page, and match the exact value given in the CSS selector. 

```html 
<p id="unique-element">Title</p>
```
