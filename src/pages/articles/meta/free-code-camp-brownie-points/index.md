The number beside your picture on Free Code Camp tells you how many Brownie Points you have.

There are two ways you can get Brownie Points:

1.  Complete challenges - you get one point per challenge you complete
2.  Help other campers in chat - each time you help another camper and they thank you (by typing "thanks <span class="mention">@yourname</span>"), you will get a point

> Brownie Points help you look like the kind of person who codes a lot, shares relevant links, and helps people.
