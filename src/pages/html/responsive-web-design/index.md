## Responsive Web Design

Responsive Web Design (RWD) is an approach that aims to maximise the compatibility of a website across a broad range of devices (such as computers, phones, tablets, etc.).

Previously, it was common practice to maintain a separate codebase for each device. However, this increased development time and reduced performance (due to the [user agent](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/user-agent/) having to perform detection and redirection tasks). These issues are resolved by RWD, which utilises a single codebase (with identical HTML output) for all devices.

A [progressive enhancement](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/css/progressive-enhancement/) (as opposed to a [graceful degradation](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/css/graceful-degradation/)) strategy is encouraged, and can be achieved with the following implementations:
1. [HTML viewport meta tag](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/html/elements/meta-tag/)
2. [Breakpoints](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/css/breakpoints/)
3. [CSS media queries](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/css/media-queries/)
4. [CSS relative units](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/css/units/)

Popular CSS frameworks (such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/)) have been developed around RWD principles, and can be advantageous for efficient prototyping.
