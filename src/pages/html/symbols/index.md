## Symbols
<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
Many mathematical, technical, and currency symbols, are not present on a normal keyboard.
To add such symbols to an HTML page, you can use an HTML entity name.
If no entity name exists, you can use an entity number, a decimal, or hexadecimal reference.
HTML code:
```
<p>I will display &euro;</p>
<p>I will display &#8364;</p>
<p>I will display &#x20AC;</p>
```
Will display as:
```
I will display €
I will display €
I will display €
```
