Range will give an indication of how spread out the numbers are.</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>Smallest value: -4\nLargest value: 20\n\n20 - (-4) = 24\n\nThe range is 24</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>To calculate the <strong>mean</strong>, add all the numbers together and divide by the total amount of elements in a group. This is what is normally meant when discussing the ‘average’.</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>5 + (-4) + 11 + 5 + 5 + 20 + 8.5 + 11 = 61.5\n\nSum: 61.5\nCount: 8\n\n61.5 / 8 = 7.6875\n\nThe mean is 7.6875</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>To calculate the <strong>mode</strong>, look for the number that is repated the most frequently. For example, for the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,7 the mode would be 7 because there are three 7s in the group, which is higher than the amount of any other number.</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>Put the set in order so it\'s easier to see how\nmany of each value there are:\n\n-4, 5, 5, 5, 8.5, 11, 11, 20\n\n5 appears three times, 11 appears twice and\neverything else appears once.\n\nThe mode is 5</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>To calculate the <strong>median</strong>, arrange all the numbers in increasing order and cross off the highest and lowest number until there is only one or two numbers left. If there is one number left, then that number is the median. If there are two numbers, then add the two numbers and divide by 2 to get the median. For example, in 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,7 the median would be 5.</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>First, put the set in order:\n\n-4, 5, 5, 5, 8.5, 11, 11, 20\n\nThe third 5 and 8.5 are the middle values...\n(5 + 8.5) / 2 = 6.75\n\nThe median is 6.75</code></pre>\n      </div>',fields:{slug:"/mathematics/mean-median-mode-and-range/"},frontmatter:{title:"Mean Median Mode and Range"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/mathematics/mean-median-mode-and-range/"}}}});
