## Unconscious Bias

<p>Unconscious biases otherwise known as Implicit bias are social stereotypes about certain groups of people that individuals form outside their own conscious awareness. Everyone holds unconscious beliefs about various social and identity groups, and these biases stem from one’s tendency to organize social worlds by categorizing.</p>

<blockquote> Bias is a prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another usually in a way that’s considered to be unfair. Biases may be held by an individual, group, or institution and can have negative or positive consequences. 
</blockquote>

<p>Unconscious bias occurs when people favour others who look like them and/or share their values. For example a person may be drawn to someone with a similar educational background, from the same area, or who is the same colour or ethnicity as them.</p>

<p>Implicit or unconscious bias happens by our brains making incredibly quick judgments and assessments of people and situations without us realising. Our biases are influenced by our background, cultural environment and personal experiences. We may not even be aware of these views and opinions, or be aware of their full impact and implications.</p>

<p>Unconscious bias is far more prevalent than conscious prejudice and often incompatible with one’s conscious values. Certain scenarios can activate unconscious attitudes and beliefs. For example, biases may be more prevalent when multi-tasking or working under time pressure.</p> 
<p>Unconscious bias can influence decisions in recruitment, promotion and performance management. It could be discriminatory when the unconscious bias relates to a protected characteristic.</p> 

<p>Dr. Scott Page's work on Wisdom of Crowds and the Diversity Theorem shows how diverse teams consistenly outperforms a homogenous team. Therefore, there is a strong business case for diversity. Inclusive leadership, which are a set of key inclusive habits - fair, open, cooperative, supportive, empowerment - are crucial in helping diverse teams thrive in performance, innovation, and job satisfaction. Daily intentional practice in these inclusive leadership habits and self awareness of unconscious bias, will go a long way in promoting a positive organizational culture. The book Blindspot: Hidden Biases of Good People by Mahzarin Banaji and Anthony Greenwald is an insightful resource on understanding unconscious bias and how to outsmart it.<p>
