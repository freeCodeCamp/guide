## How to Install Node JS and NPM on Windows

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a runtime environment for running server-side code. NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package ecosystem that comes installed with Node.js. NPM contains a large number of open source JavaScript libraries that can be quickly installed from the command line.

1. Download the latest Windows installer from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and run the .msi file. You'll need to restart after you've gone through the installation.
2. In order to test whether Node.js has been properly installed, open Powershell, or type `cmd` in the Start Menu for the command prompt, and type `node -v`, which will return the version of the installation. NPM Should be installed with Node.js, and you can check whether it's installed similarly, by typing `npm -v`. You can also create a test JavaScript file and run it by typing node followed by the filename (you have to be in the working directory where the file is located). 
3. The easiest way to update NodeJS and NPM is to download the newest version of the installer, but there are other [methods](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/npm-windows-upgrade) that use Powershell.
