## XAML

Pronounced "zammel", XAML is an XML-based markup language developed by Microsoft. 

## Example
Creating a TextBlock with several properties.  TextBlocks are usually employed for the output of text, much like Labels in older versions of the .NET framework.
```xml
<TextBlock Text="I am a TextBlock!" 
	HorizontalAlignment="Left" 
	FontSize="25" 
	FontWeight="Bold" 
	Margin="50,10,0,0" />
```
