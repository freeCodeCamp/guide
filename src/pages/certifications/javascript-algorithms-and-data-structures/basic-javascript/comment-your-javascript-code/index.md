## Comment Your JavaScript Code

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
Commenting allows you to type stuff that you don't want the computer to run as code. For example, notes to other programmers, directions, and more. Here's how to create a single-line comment.

    // Hey, I'm a comment!

Now, if you want to comment an entire paragraph, that can be easily accomplished with...

    /*
      Hey, I'm a paragraph comment.
      This allows for programmers to
      write tons and tons of random
      words, without the fear of me
      being compiled!
    */
