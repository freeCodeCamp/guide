## Personas

A persona is a fictional character that represents a subset of users of a site, application, brand or product.

A persona is created, or synthesized, from data collected from interviews with users . The persona should represent the typical behavior of a group, or the way in which that group interacts with the site, application, brand, or project.

The description of the persona should include the end-goal that the character wishes to achieve - what problem are they trying to solve in using the site, application or product? What is their motivation? A persona will have identifying attributes; for example a name, job, etc, that allows the design team to identify with them.
