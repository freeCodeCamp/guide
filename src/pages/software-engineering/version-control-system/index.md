<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->

A Version Control System is a tool used by developers to manage changes to files, documents and computer programs over time. 

Each change made to the document is tracked, including who made the change, the date and time it was made and usually why they made the change, for example to fix a problem or add an enhancement. 

Each revision can be labelled with an incremental number or code, such as “version 2”, “v3”, etc.  

Revisions to the document can be compared, restored or merged with a previous version.
