## B Tag

The `<b>` tag is used to make the text placed between the tags as Bold.
The `<b>` tag represents a span of text.
It is stylistically different from normal text. 

Here is an example on how to use them.

`<b>I am bold text </b>`

Which results in:

<b>I am bold text</b>

### Note:

The text inside a `<b>` tag does not convey any importance it is just to make the text bold.
To make text bold and convey some importance `<strong>` tag is used.
You should not use `<b>` tag to make Heading bold rather use the Heading tags from `<h1>` till `<h6>`.
