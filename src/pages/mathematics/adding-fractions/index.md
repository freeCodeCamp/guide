## Adding Fractions

A fraction is comprised of a numerator (the top number) and the denominator (the bottom number). If two fractions have the same denominator, they can be added together by combining their numerators:

**1**/5 + **2**/5 = **3**/5

You might also be able to simplify the result:

**3**/4 + **1**/4 = **4**/4 = **1**/**1** = **1**

**3**/8 + **1**/8 = **4**/8 = **1**/**2**

### Unlike Denominators

If the two fractions don't have the same denominator, you will need to _make_ them the same before completing the addition. Your goal is to make an **equivalent fraction** for one or both fractions before adding:

1/2 + 1/4 = ?

_multiply 1/2 by 2/2 to make an equivalent fraction with the same denominator as 1/4_

( (**2**/**2**) _x_ (**1**/**2**) ) + 1/4 = ?

**2**/**4** + 1/4 = 3/4

### Finding a common denominator
In the example above, we easily found a common denominator because the first fraction's denominator was a factor of the second fraction's denominator. What if this isn't the case? Simply multiply each fraction by the denominator of the other fraction:

2/3 + 1/4 = ?

( (**4**/**4**) _x_ (**2**/**3**) ) + 1/4 = ?

**8**/**12** + 1/4 = ?

**8**/**12** + ( (**3**/**3**) _x_ (**1**/**4**) ) = ?

**8**/**12** + **3**/**12** = **11**/**12**
