# Foreach Loop

The `foreach` loop executes a block of code for __each__ element in a collection whereas a `for` loop performs the operation until a condition is met.

## Example
```
int[] arrayOfNumbers = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
foreach (int n in arrayOfNumbers)
{
  Console.WriteLine(n);
}
```

## Output:
```
> 0
> 1
> 2
> 3
> 4
> 5
> 6
> 7
> 8 
> 9
```
