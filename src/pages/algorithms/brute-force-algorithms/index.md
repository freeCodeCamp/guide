## Brute Force Algorithms
<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
The brute force approach is an optimal, but ineffective method to resolve problems. If you have to choose between various options, you simply select each and every option, so you can evaluate the cost of each one, and then simple select the best. This method always gives you the best answer (is optimal) but if the options to test are too much, it could be slow and/or expensive (ineffective)
