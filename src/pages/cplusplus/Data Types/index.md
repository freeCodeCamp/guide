# Data Types

When declaring variables in c++ they must have a name to which you will reffer later on, a value (constant or not) and a type.
The type will tell the compiler the values that the variable can use, the possible operations and will save a certain space in memmory.
In c++ there are two types of data:
* Simple type
* Struct type

## Simple data types

* Boolean -- bool
Works like a switch, can be on or off.
```cpp
bool GameRunning = true;
```
* Character -- char
Stores a single character.
```cpp
char a;
a = 'H';
```
* Integer  -- int
Stores an [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer).
```cpp
int x = 2;
```
* Floating point  -- float
* Double floating point  -- double
Double precision of the float type.

### These types can also be modified with modifiers such as:
signed
unsigned
short
long
