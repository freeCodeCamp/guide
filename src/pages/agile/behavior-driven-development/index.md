Behavior Driven Development or BDD is a process of software development, although it is mainly related to Testing

The test is written in plain english because BDD seeks a common language to join the technical and business logic and it describe the set of the behaviors that the user can expect from the system.

In BDD, tests are written using user stories, user stories are simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user. They typically follow a simple template:
As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.

And, following with the above, later write acceptance criteria for those user stories, doing it in terms of scenarios:
Given [initial context], when [event occurs], then [ensure some outcomes].
Thus, simplified, the basic cycle of BDD would be the following ...
1 - Write the user stories.
2 - Write the scenarios.
3 - Automate acceptance tests.
