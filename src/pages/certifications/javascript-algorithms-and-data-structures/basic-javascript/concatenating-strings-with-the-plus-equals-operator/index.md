## Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
The '+=' operator can concatenate (link) strings easily. Make sure your spelling is right, and you've left appropriate spaces.

    var str = "Hello ";
    str += "coding"; // Now the string reads "Hello coding"
    str += "camper!"; // And now the string reads "Hello codingcamper!"
