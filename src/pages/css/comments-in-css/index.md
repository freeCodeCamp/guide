## Comments in CSS

Comments are used in CSS to explain a block of code or to make temporary changes during development. The commented code doesn't execute. The comment syntax in CSS works for both single and multi-line comments.

``` css
    /*
        This is
        a multi-line
        comment
    */
    /* This is a single line comment*/
    .group:after {
        content: "";
        display: table;
        clear: both;
    }
```

You can add as many comments to your stylesheet as you like. Itâ€™s good practice to use CSS comments to help identify parts of any stylesheet that might be difficult to understand from a cursory glance. Comments are especially important when working in a team, when your code must be understood by others. By using CSS comments to make your stylesheets more readable, the CSS will be easier to maintain in the future.

## Comment Formats

Comments should be used everyday in your CSS to keep in maintainable and readable by any dev who dives into said CSS.
Here are a few exmples to get you started of CSS comments you can use in your daily work to make your life that bit easier.
