## Syntax

PHP is a language allowing you to include dynamic content in otherwise static webpages. It is written inline with html, simply rename a .html file to .php (web-server must have php installed) to get started.

```PHP
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>PHP Example</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>PHP Example</h1>
<?php
  echo "Hello World from PHP!";
?>
</body>
</html>
```
