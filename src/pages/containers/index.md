## Containers

Containers are an operating-system-level virtualization. It is an operating system feature in which the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances. Such instances, called containers may look like real computers from the point of view of programs running in them.

Containers are also data structures, class or an abstract data type that contains an object that follows specific rules. These objects can be single value containers, each object is independant, or Associative containers, such as an array.
