## Modify Array Data With Indexes

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
Access the position of the array, and change it, like so:

```javascript
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
arr[0] = 6; // Now, the array is [6, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr[4] = 10 // Now, the array is [6, 2, 3, 4, 10]
```

The important concept here is that arrays are **mutable**. This means that they can be changed easily.
