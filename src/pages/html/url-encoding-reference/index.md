<p>Servers and browers do not understand the URLs as we do. They cannot read a specific list of characters (such as the well-known whitespace), forcing the URLs to be formatted. The format is called ASCII character-set.</p>

<p>Not-ASCII characters are replaced by a formula, starting with '%' and followed by two characters.</p>

<p>As an example, the URL <i>hello world.html</i> must be replaced by <i>hello%20world.html</i>
