## Images in HTML
Images can improve the design and the apperance of a web page.
### The Syntax
In HTML, images are defined with the `<img>` tag.

The `<img>` tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The src attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the image:

`<img src="url">`

### The alt - Attribute
The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

`<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">`

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:

### Image Size - Width and Height
You can give the `<img>` Attribute a width and height by using it like this:
`<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">`
