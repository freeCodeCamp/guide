## Rational Numbers

A rational number is any number that can be written as a fraction of two integers. _10/5_ is a fraction, and is equal to 2. _8/3_ is a fraction, and is equal to 2.66666 (where 6 repeats infinetly many times). Since any integer can be used to express a fraction, all integers are also rational. As we saw, 2 could be written as _10/5_, but it can also be written as _2/1_. As any integer __n__ can be written as ___n__/1_, all integers are rational. 
Because a rational number has to be written as a fraction of 2 integers, _pi_ and _e_ are not rational, as they cannot be expressed as fractions with whole numbers.
