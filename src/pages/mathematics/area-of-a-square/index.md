## Area of a Square

A square is a quadrilateral with identical sides.

The area of a square can be calculated either from the length of the side, or from the length of the diagonal.

If the side *a* is known:

If the diagonal *d* is known:

The relationship between side *a* and diagonal *d* is:

### Terminology

Diagonal - the distance from opposite corners of a square. The corners are 90-degrees.

Perimeter - the sum of the length of four sides in a square. The four sides are equal in a square.

### Examples

1. Given length of one side of square is 8 units:

   Area = 8 x 8 = 64 units<sup>2</sup>
   
2. Given area of a square is 100 units<sup>2</sup>:

   Length = <span>&#8730;</span>100 = 10 units
   
3. Given diagonal of square is 25 units:

   Area = 10<sup>2</sup> / 2 = 50 units<sup>2</sup>
  
4. Given perimeter of a square is 20 units:

   Area = (20 / 4)<sup>2</sup> = 25  units<sup>2</sup>
