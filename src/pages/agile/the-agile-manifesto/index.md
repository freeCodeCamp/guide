## The Manifesto

Manifesto for agile software development: 
  - Individuals and interactions over process and tools.
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation.
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
  - Responding change over following a plan.

"We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work, we have come to value."

The four fundamentals promises behind the entire Agile software development practices. These came about in response to the prior process-heavy ways of software development. Twelve basic Principles suppliment the Manifesto to help you guide practicing Agile. Both the Agile Manifesto and the Principles have not changed for decades. They are both brief and capture the essence of Agile with clarity. Visit http://agilemanifesto.org to read both. 

As large enterprises adopt Agile they need to come up with specific processes and rules. These processes and rules get misrepresented as Agile. You will find the manifesto useful every time you run into this. You can use Agile Manifesto to help resolve conflict based on such misrepresentation. 

The Agile Manifesto and Principles are effective for non software projects as well.
