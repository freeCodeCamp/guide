title: Specify How Fonts Should Degrade
---
There are several default fonts that are available in all browsers. These include `Monospace`, `Serif` and `Sans-Serif`.

For example, if you wanted an element to use the `Helvetica` font, but also degrade to the `Sans-Serif` font when `Helvetica` wasn't available, you could use this CSS style: `p { font-family: Helvetica, Sans-Serif; }`.
