## Help on Algorithms

Live currently on the HelpBonFires channel on Gitter <a href='https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/HelpBonfires' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/HelpBonfires</a>

We've added some Algorithm specific commands. If you type `Algorithm $BONFIRENAME` (where $BONFIRENAME is part of a Algorithm name) it will set the chat to be about that Algorithm. Then you can use some other Algorithm specific commands:

*   bf details - more info
*   bf spoiler - show some hints

## More commands

*   `update` pulls new wiki edits asap
*   `topics` selected pages from the wiki
*   `rooms` all rooms the bot is in
*   `archives` show history
*   `music` deprecated, plug DJ no longer exists.
*   `twitch` show the twitch feed

## Content for the wiki

Feel free to make new pages, an example entry is here: <a href='https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/example' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/example</a>

## Source Repository

## Roadmap

We're looking for ideas for new features to add, and some people to help working on the bot. Have a look at Tickets with <a href='https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/camperbot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>help wanted</a> on the repo and maybe you can contribute?

In future, we're planning:

*   Algorithm step-by-step tutorials will be available via chat and from the CamperBot
*   realtime tagging and searching of chats by topic
*   a scripting language and natural language processing Get involved and let us know what you'd like to see next!

## Developer Chatroom

*   <a href='https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/camperbot' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Join us on our repository chat room</a> to discuss new features. Perhaps we can pair up to work on the bot 2.0!
*   <a href='https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/camperbotPlayground' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Join this chat room</a> to mess around with the CamperBot and try out commands, proofread your edits to wiki content etc.
