#CD-Rom Drives

A CD-Rom (Compact Disc, read-only-memory) drive is a computer hardware expansion device conected via an IDE 
for reading CD-ROM discs like music disk or disk that contain data.


##Advantages
Up to 650 MB of data fit on a single 5-inch disc. (Smaller than the original 5.25-inch floppydisk, 
a CD holds almost 2000 times as much information.)The CD is a portable medium.A CD is read-only,which prevents accidental 
erasure of programs or files. More durable than the standard 5.25-inch or 3.5-inch disks, CDs are not magnetic media andthus 
are not subject to the same dangers posed by proximity to electrical sources or magnets.
