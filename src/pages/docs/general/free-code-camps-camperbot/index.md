Hi, I'm **[CamperBot](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/camperbot)**! I can help you in this chatroom ![:smile:](//forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=2 ":smile:")

### Basic Commands:

*   `find TOPIC` find all entries about topic. e.g. `find js`
*   `wiki TOPIC` show contents of topic page
*   `thanks @username` send brownie points to another user
*   `about @username` shows info on that user
*   `Algorithm BONFIRENAME` info on a Algorithm

meet CamperBot in [![FreeCodeCamp/camperbotPlayground](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitter_Chat_Room:-FreeCodeCamp/camperbotPlayground_%E2%86%91-006400.svg?style=flat-square&maxAge=2592000%29.svg)](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/camperbotPlayground)

## Example Commands

    wiki muta  # first entry with muta in name

For playing with CamperBot please use the testing channel: [https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/camperbotPlayground](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/camperbotPlayground)

## Help on Algorithms

Live currently on the HelpBonFires channel on Gitter [https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/HelpBonfires](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/HelpBonfires)

We've added some Algorithm specific commands. If you type `Algorithm $BONFIRENAME` (where $BONFIRENAME is part of a Algorithm name) it will set the chat to be about that Algorithm. Then you can use some other Algorithm specific commands:

*   bf details - more info
*   bf spoiler - show some hints

## More commands

*   `update` pulls new wiki edits asap
*   `topics` selected pages from the wiki
*   `rooms` all rooms the bot is in
*   `archives` show history
*   `music` deprecated, plug DJ no longer exists.
*   `twitch` show the twitch feed

## Content for the wiki

Feel free to make new pages, an example entry is here: [https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/example](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/example)

## Source Repository

`https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/camperbot`

Fork it and have fun!

## Roadmap

We're looking for ideas for new features to add, and some people to help working on the bot. Have a look at Tickets with [help wanted](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/camperbot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) on the repo and maybe you can contribute?

In future, we're planning:

*   Algorithm step-by-step tutorials will be available via chat and from the CamperBot
*   realtime tagging and searching of chats by topic
*   a scripting language and natural language processing Get involved and let us know what you'd like to see next!

## Developer Chatroom

*   [Join us on our repository chat room](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/camperbot) to discuss new features. Perhaps we can pair up to work on the bot 2.0!
*   [Join this chat room](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/camperbotPlayground) to mess around with the CamperBot and try out commands, proofread your edits to wiki content etc.
