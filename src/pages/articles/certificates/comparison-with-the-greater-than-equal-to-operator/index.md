title: Comparison with the Greater Than Equal To Operator
---
The greater than equal to operator (`>=`) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Like the equality operator, greater than equal to operator will convert data types while comparing.

## Examples

     6  >=  6  // true
     7  >= '3' // true
     2  >=  3  // false
    '7' >=  9  // false
