title: Why Does Free Code Camp Uses JavaScript Instead of Ruby or Python
---
Like JavaScript, Ruby and Python are high-level scripting languages that can be used for full stack web development.

But even if you learned these languages, you'd still need to learn JavaScript. That's because JavaScript is the only language that runs in web browsers. JavaScript has been around for 20 years, and it is still growing in popularity.

Because of this, JavaScript has more tools and online learning resources than any other language.
