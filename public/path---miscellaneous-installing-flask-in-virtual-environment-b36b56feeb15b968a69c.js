But install Flask, only because you want to explore web development in Flask. We would always recommend Django over Flask, because it gets difficult to build large web-applications in Flask; if you are new to web development in Python.</p>\n<p>Flask is a micro-framework; and you can pick the functionality you wish to have over the basic barebone functionality you already have from a standard web-framework. But if you don’t wish to do all the hassle and focus on building your idea; perhaps <a>Django</a> would be a better company for the road ahead.</p>\n<p>I am going to assume you have <strong>not</strong> skipped the section on installing Python 3 and using it inside a virtual environment.</p>\n<p>First make sure that you are not inside a virtual environment already. Then create a new virtual environment, named <code>py3-flask</code></p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>$ mkvirtualenv py3-flask --python=/usr/bin/python3</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Now, execute the <code>workon</code> command to see a list of virtual environments in your machine. This should list <code>py3-flask</code> in a line.</p>\n<p>After this, activate this environment:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>$ workon py3-flask</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Your virtual environment would be activated with a copy of Python interpreter, with Python 3 properties. You should run</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>$ python --version</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>to ensure that you are indeed inside a Python 3 environment.</p>\n<p>Just to be clear, if you have already installed Django following the previous section - it should <strong>not</strong> be in this environment. We are using virtual environment; to keep our installation of different frameworks separated.</p>\n<p>To be sure, run</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>pip freeze</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Make sure Django is not listed in the output list generated by above command.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s install Flask. For your peruse, here’s the <a href=\'http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/installation/\' target=\'_blank\' rel=\'nofollow\'>official installation guide</a>. However, a lot of developers prefer installing some extra packages with Flask; for more functionality.</p>\n<p>To install just Flask, exeute</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>$ pip install flask</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>When you run <code>pip freeze</code> again, it should show you <code>Flask</code> in listed packages.</p>\n<p>It is cumbersome running long commands like this. Fortunately, there is something like <code>package.json</code> in Python domain as well - a list of dependencies, which the package manager can use to duplicate the environment by downloading them with proper version from central repo.</p>\n<p>The standard is to use <code>pip freeze</code> and log the output to a local file, which can be source controlled.</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>$ pip freeze > requirements.txt</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Here’s the content of <code>requirements.txt</code> from my environment, after installing those Flask packages. You may add or remove more packages as your application grows; but for now, just copy paste the content of the following in a text file in the same directory as you are in.</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>Babel==2.2.0\nFlask==0.10.1\nFlask-Babel==0.9\nFlask-Login==0.3.2\nFlask-Mail==0.9.1\nFlask-OpenID==1.2.5\nFlask-SQLAlchemy==2.1\nFlask-WTF==0.12\nFlask-WhooshAlchemy==0.56\nJinja2==2.8\nMarkupSafe==0.23\nSQLAlchemy==1.0.12\nTempita==0.5.2\nWTForms==2.1\nWerkzeug==0.11.4\nWhoosh==2.7.2\nblinker==1.4\ncoverage==4.0.3\ndecorator==4.0.9\ndefusedxml==0.4.1\nflipflop==1.0\nguess-language==0.2\nitsdangerous==0.24\npbr==1.8.1\npython3-openid==3.0.9\npytz==2015.7\nsix==1.10.0\nspeaklater==1.3\nsqlalchemy-migrate==0.10.0\nsqlparse==0.1.18</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This list of packages are taken from <a href=\'http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world\' target=\'_blank\' rel=\'nofollow\'>here</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you have saved the file, just run</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>$ pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>The package manager would take care of installing missing packages for you! And you should commit this file with your source control system.</p>\n<p>The above set of commands assume that you have a Linux machine or Mac OSX machine; or you are using a cloud-hosted box on cloud9 or Nitrous; or maybe you are using a Vagrant box.</p>\n<p>But, if you have to use a Windows machine, do consider using Windows Powershell, instead of Windows CMD. Most of the commands would be same.
