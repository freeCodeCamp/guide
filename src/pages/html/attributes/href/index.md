In the most basic of definitions, the Hypertext Reference or href is HTML code used to create a link to another page.
The href attribute used in conjunction with the <a> tag specifies an assigned link's destination.  

Example:
  <!-- In this example the href attribute has been assigned the link to freecodecamp's website. When the user clicks on the Visit FreeCodeCamp, the href, assuming it is linked correctly, will then take the user to the website. Based on the code below, the tab the user is on in their browser will go to FreeCodeCamp. -->
  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Visit FreeCodeCamp</a>
  
 <!-- If you want a new tab to open up and redirect the user to the assigned website you have to include the target attribute of _blank along with your href in the <a> tag -->
  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">Visit FreeCodeCamp</a>
 
 It is important to note that if there is no href assigned within the <a> tag, there will be no hyperlink. However, if a placeholder is needed, the # can be used. The href="#" doesn't specify an id name (ids are something you will learn more about when you study CSS), but does have a corresponding location which is the top of the page. Clicking a hyperlink with an href="#" will simply move the scroll position to the top of the page the user is on. 

Href is an important tool as it will be used when you create navigation both within your own website as well as sending users to external sites.
