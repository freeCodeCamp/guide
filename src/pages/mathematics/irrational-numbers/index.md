## Irrational Numbers

An irrational number is a number that cannot be written as fully on decimal form. A popular example is the number _Pi_, as it cannot be fully written. There are an infinite number of decimals, and therefore it is irrational. 
The same goes for the number _e_ and the square root of 2. they cannot be written down as they have an infinite number of decimals, and they are therefore irrational.
