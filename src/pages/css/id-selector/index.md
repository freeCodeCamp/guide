title: ID Selector

## ID Selector
The CSS ID selector applies styles to a specific html element. The CSS ID selector must match the ID attribute of an HTML element. 
Unlike classes, which can be applied to multiple elements throughout a site, a specific ID may only be applied to one single element on a site. 
CSS ID will override CSS Class properties.
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

### Syntax
```css
#specified_id { /* styles */ }
```
You can combine the ID selector with other types of selectors to style a very specific element.
```css
section#about:hover { color: blue; }

div.classname#specified_id { color: green; }
```
### Note about IDs

ID should be avoided when styling if possible. As it has high specificity and it can be overriden only if you inline styles, or add styles into ```<style>```. The weight of ID override class selectors and type selectors.

Remember, the ID selector must match an HTML element's ID attribute.
```html
<div id="specified_id"><!-- content --></div>
```

### Specificity 
ID selectors have a high specificity making them difficult to override. Classes have a much lower specificity and are generally the preferred way to style elements in order to avoid specificity issues. [Specificity on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity)
