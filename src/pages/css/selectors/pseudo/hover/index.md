## Hover

The hover pseudo class selector is generally used for styling elements which are being hovered, to add styling to the hover state on the element. I.e. when hovering over a button, you change the color.

**Styling for the hover state:**
```css
.foo {
  color: green;
}

.foo:hover {
  color: red;
}
```
