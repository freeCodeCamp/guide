## What is an API

API stands for Application Programming Interface. Don’t worry about the AP, just focus on the I. An API is an interface. You use interfaces all the time. A computer operating system is an interface. Buttons in an elevator are an interface. A gas pedal in a car is an interface.

An interface sits on top of a complicated system and simplifies certain tasks, a middleman that saves you from needing to know all the details of what’s happening under the hood. A web API is the same sort of thing. It sits on top of a web service, like Twitter or YouTube, and simplifies certain tasks for you. It translates your actions into the technical details for the computer system on the other end.

The term API can be used in a number of ways; I'll restrict my answer to the APIs used by websites such as Twitter, Basecamp, Zendesk, Slack etc.

The main advantage of providing an API is that it allows your users to do more with your product or service (i.e. it increases the value of your product). This typically takes one of two forms - 
an integration.  An example of an integration is to push notifications from your product (such as CRM, Helpdesk) to a messaging tool such as Slack. In this way, if your customer uses Slack they can receive notifications without having to login directly to your system or check emails.
new functionality. In the early days of Twitter, some of the most popular Twitter clients were produced by third parties using the Twitter API. Twitter and its users benefited from the new functionality that was undertaken by other companies.

The disadvantages to providing an API are,
Cost. Providing an API is expensive in terms of development time, ongoing maintenance, providing API documentation on your website and providing support to users of your API.
Security exposure. Adding an API adds another attack surface to your website.
You might not like the result or you may change business direction. It's not always easy to predict exactly how your API will be used. If your integration with a messaging system means that users login to your service less often, will there be an overall negative impact for you? Withdrawing an API can be painful for users if you decide that you need to do so. This is unusual but it can happen. As Twitter's business evolved it changed its rules for accessing its API which resulted in a number of problems for users and developers (see Twitter and What Might Have Been - Stratechery by Ben Thompson).
