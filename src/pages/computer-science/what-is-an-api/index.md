## What Is an Api

An application Programming Interface (API) is a set of instructions and standards for accessing or interacting with a software tool or service. These services are generally software-to-software based with no user interface. 

Popular web-based API's include services from Google Maps, Twitter and Facebook. These software companies may release their API's to the public so other developers may design products to be powered by their service. For example Amazon may release it's API so that a website developer could easily access information of products on Amazon. Using the Amazon API, any third party website can post information and a direct link for a product with real time prices and an option to buy the product on Amazon.
