title: Use the Bootstrap Grid to Put Elements Side by Side
---
Bootstrap uses a responsive grid system that makes it easier to put elements into rows and tell each element's relative width.

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a href='https://www.evernote.com/shard/s116/sh/f0944d97-08b8-4615-8273-a327bf41fb05/de1a3acbceef89ae/deep/0/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>![Bootstrap 12 column grid layout</a>

<div class="meta"><span class="filename">0</span><span class="informations">901x348</span><span class="expand"></span></div>](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s116/sh/f0944d97-08b8-4615-8273-a327bf41fb05/de1a3acbceef89ae/deep/0/ "0") </div>

Note that in this illustration, the `col-md-_` class is being used. Here, md means medium, and _ is a number specifying how many columns wide the element should be. In this case, the column width of an element on a medium-sized screen, such as a laptop, is being specified.

    <div class="row">

      <div class="col-xs-4"><button class="btn btn-block btn-primary">Like</button></div>
      <div class="col-xs-4"><button class="btn btn-block btn-info">Info</button></div>
      <div class="col-xs-4"><button class="btn btn-block btn-danger">Delete</button></div>

    </div>
