## Use Tab Space Instead of Multiple Non Breaking Spaces Nbsp

In HTML the most common way to add multiple spaces is by adding `&nbsp;` for each space. To add a tab space put your text in `<pre>` tags, for example `<pre>My Text Here</pre>` and every tab will be treated as eight spaces. Another way to add multiple spaces in HTML would be to use CSS for example `<p style="padding-right: 5px;">My Text Here</p>`.
