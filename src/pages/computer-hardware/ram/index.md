## Ram

RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It serves as a super-fast way for the processor (sometimes refered to as the CPU) to acess code which it needs often. It is often measured in Gigabytes (GB).

In order to understand the difference between the computer's RAM and hard drive, it is best to use an analogy: picture the hard drive as a filing cabinet and the RAM as a table which you work at. The majority of your files are stored in the filing cabinet, and it can severely slow you down if everytime you want to access a file you have to grab it from the cabinet. In order to speed up your workflow, you can place a liminuted number of files on the table at a time. Thus, the larger the table, the more files you can place on it. And by being able to place more files on the table at once, you increase your speed. The relationship between a computer's RAM and it's hard drive is very similar; the more RAM a computer has access to, the larger and more complex programs it can have on hand at any given time without having to access its hard drive.

Another key difference between a computer's hard drive and RAM is whether or not the files on it are stored when the computer is turned off. RAM requries a constant stream of electricity for it to retain the information stored in it, meaning that when the computer is turned off the RAM is cleared. Hard drives do not. This is one of the primary reasons why RAM isn't used for a computer's main storage, despite it's speed. The other major factor is cost.

It is important to note that RAM is often referrerd to as memory, just as a hard drive is often referred to as a computer's storage. It is important not to switch these two terms, despite their seeming similarities.
