## HTML5 Video

HTML5 Video element provides native support for embedding any video file without any third party plugin (like Adobe Flash Player).

#### Example:

    <video width="320" height="240" autoplay>
      <source src="video_file_or_link.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <source src="video_file_or_link.ogg" type="video/ogg">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>

This element provides some special properties, methods and events for different user interactions using Javascript.
[W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_av_dom.asp) has a good reference for this.
