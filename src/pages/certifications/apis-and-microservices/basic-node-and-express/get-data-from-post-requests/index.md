## Get Data from POST Requests


<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->

Just like using req.query we can do req.body to get our data. This challenge is very similar to "Get Query Parameter Input from the Client."

In order to get data from a post request a general format is:

```javascript
app.post(PATH, function(req, res) {
  // Handle the data in the request
});
```
