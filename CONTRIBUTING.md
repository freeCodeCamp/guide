# How to contribute

## Filing an issue

If you want your issue to be resolved quickly, please include in your issue:

* Gatsby version, node.js version, OS version
* The contents of your `gatsby-config.js` and `package.json` as well as your
  `gatsby-node.js`, `gatsby-browser.js` `gatsby-ssr.js` files depending on
  changes you've made there.

## Contributing
You can install the latest version of Gatsby by following these steps:

* Clone the repo, navigate to its directory.
* Install dependencies using `npm install` in the root of the repo.

The usual contributing steps are:

* Fork the [official repository](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby).
* Clone your fork: git clone `git@github.com:<your-username>/gatsby.git`
* Install gatsby-dev-cli globally: `npm install -g gatsby-dev-cli@canary`
* Checkout the 1.0 branch: `git checkout 1.0`
* Install dependencies: `npm install`
* Make sure tests are passing for you: `npm test`
* Create a topic branch: `git checkout -b topics/new-feature-name`
* Run `npm run watch` to do an initial Babel build of all packages and watch for
  changes to packages' source code and compile changes on the fly as you
  work.
* For each of your Gatsby test sites, run the `gatsby-dev` command there to copy
  the built files from your cloned copy of Gatsby. It'll watch for your changes
  to Gatsby packages and copy them into the site. For more detailed
  instructions see the [gatsby-dev-cli README](/packages/gatsby-dev-cli/)
* Add tests and code for your changes.
* Once you're done, make sure all tests still pass: `npm test`
* Commit and push to your fork.
* Create an pull request from your branch.

## Development tools

### Redux devtools

Gatsby uses Redux for managing state during development and building. It's
often helpful to see the flow of actions and builtup state for a site you're
working on or if adding new functionality to core. We leverage
https://github.com/zalmoxisus/remote-redux-devtools and
https://github.com/zalmoxisus/remotedev-server to give you use the Redux
devtools extension for debugging Gatsby.

To use this, first install
[redux-devtools-extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)
in your browser. Then in your Gatsby repo, run `npm run remotedev`. Then in
your site directory run `REDUX_DEVTOOLS=true gatsby develop`. Depending on
your operating system and shell, you may need to modify how you set the
`REDUX_DEVTOOLS` environment variable.

At this point, your site will be sending Redux actions and state to the remote server.

To connect to this, you need to setup the devtools extension to talk to the remote
server.

First open the remote devtools.

Then click settings along the bottom menu and set the host and port.

After this, the devtools extension *should* connect to the remote server and you'll
see actions start showing up.

**Warning!! Lots of buginess**. While having this available is extreamly
helpful, this setup is very buggy and fragile. There is a memory leak in the
extension that's triggered it seems every time you restart the Gatsby
development server. Also the extension often, for no apparent reason, just
won't show any actions from the remote server. It'll also often freeze up. The
best solution seems to just be turning everything off and on again.  Fixing up
these tools would be very helpful for us and many others using these tools if
someone wants to take this on!
