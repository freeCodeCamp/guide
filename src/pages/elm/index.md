## Elm

Elm is a domain-specific, purely functional programming language that compiles into Javascript. This programming language is statically typed, and was developed with an emphasis on usability, performance, and robustness. Elm was built by Evan Czaplicki in 2012, and was influenced by Haskell, Standard ML, and OCaml among others. It also helped to inspire the popular state management tool, Redux.
