A scrummaster is a leadership role in an agile development team.  This person is responsible for facilitating achievement of consensus, goals and timeframes, ensuring team focus, and removing obstacles and distractions.<sup>1</sup>

Scrummasters are servant leaders<sup>2</sup>: "Instead of the people working to serve the leader, the leader exists to serve the people.  When leaders shift their mindset and serve first, they unlock purpose and ingenuity in those around them, resulting in higher performance and engagaged, fulfilled employees."<sup>3</sup>
