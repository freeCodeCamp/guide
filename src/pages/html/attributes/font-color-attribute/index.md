## Font Color Attribute

You can use the `<font color="######">` attribute to specify the color of text on a webpage. This is done by changing the ###### to a hexadecimal value or simple color word (such as "red").

 Examples:
```html
<html>
  <font color="FF0000">
    This will appear as red text!
  </font>
</html>
```

```html
<html>
  <font color="red">
    This will also appear as red text!
  </font>
</html>
```
