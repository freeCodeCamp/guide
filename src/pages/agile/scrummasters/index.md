## Scrummasters

Scrummasters facilitate the process of scrum in agile software development. They should not be confused for project managers. Project managers are held accountable for an outcome while scrummasters manage a process. 

Scrummasters track this process through regular "standup" meetings or scrums. During these scrums, they ask three key questions:

* What happened yesterday?
* What will happen today?
* What challenges are you facing?

#### Key Responsibilites

Scrummasters are responsible for: 

1. Defining specific goals to be achieved in a sprint. 
2. Guiding the team to reach common ground during the daily scrums.
3. Ensuring team focus and accountability.
4. Eliminating obstacles that hinder team progress.
5. Keeping external distractions far from the team.
