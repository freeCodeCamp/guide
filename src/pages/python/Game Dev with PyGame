## Game Dev With PyGame

The pygame library is an open-source module for the Python programming language specifically built for creating graphical games with ease. You don't have to worry about the complexities of graphics, math, physics, etc.

## Installing PyGame and Importing PyGame

Download link for PyGame (Python 3.6): https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

Once you have PyGame installed, you can import it using:
'''python
import pygame
'''python

## Basic PyGame Program Structure
This will be your main loop that runs your game:
'''python
import pygame # Import the PyGame Module

pygame.init() # Initialize 
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((400, 400)) # Set window dimensions
running = True # Boolean variable for game loop

while running: # While our game is running
	for event in pygame.event.get(): # Empties the event queue
		if event.type == pygame.QUIT: # Close button 
			running = False # Game closed

	display.flip() # Updates the screen
quit() # Closing the game window
'''python

## Drawing Stuff
When we first run the code above, all we get is a black screen. BORING! Let's draw something onto it.

Drawing a blue rectangle:
'''python
import pygame # Import the PyGame Module

pygame.init() # Initialize 
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((400, 400)) # Set window dimensions
running = True # Boolean variable for game loop

while running: # While our game is running
	for event in pygame.event.get(): # Empties the event queue
		if event.type == pygame.QUIT: # Close button 
			running = False # Game closed

	pygame.draw.rect(screen, (0, 0, 255), pygame.Rect(30, 30, 120, 200)) # Draws a blue rectagle at postion (30, 30) with size (120, 200) pixels.

	display.flip() # Updates the screen
quit() # Closing the game window
'''python
