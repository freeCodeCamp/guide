## Hard Drives

Hard drives are large, spinning disks that store long-term data for the computer.

Hard drives come in various sizes, some up to even 8TB (8 trillion bytes). Typical computers come with between 256GB (256 million bytes) to 1TB. Laptops usually use Solid State Drives (SSDs) because they are faster and lighter. SSDs are more expensive, however, and can not store as much data for the price. 

Hard drives use magnetic needles and rotating platters to store data. Because of the moving parts, hard drives are easily damaged by dropping. They also consume a lot of power, but no other storage device is as cheap or reliable.

Computers store files on hard drives for later use. Because they have moving parts, it takes much longer to read a file from a hard drive than from RAM or memory on the CPU. 

You can think of a hard drive as a pantry: a place to store things that we aren't using right now, but need later. You don't have enough room in our kitchen for all your food, so you store things you aren't using right now in the pantry. A computer does just this. It keeps things it is using right now in RAM, and things it might need later stay on the hard drive.
