## Functional Managers

Traditionally, functional managers are responsible for a business unit, product, or service.  Functional managers 
  - manage tasks, resources, and processes to achieve organizational goals. 
  - facilitate communication between the project team, stakeholders, and management. 
  - eliminate roadblocks.
  
In an Agile organization, these tasks shift to other people, such as the Scrum Master, Product Owner, or the team itself.  Functional managers often resist this loss of control and authority.  What's left for them to do?

Not much.  The functional manager sets the team up but is not a team member.  A functional manager can support the team from the outside, as a champion or sponsor.  He or she might also handle personnel issues.  In most cases, the functional manager will need to transition to a new role.
