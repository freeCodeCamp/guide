Timing Events<br>
The window object allows execution of code at specified time intervals.<br>
These time intervals are called timing events.<br>

The two key methods to use with JavaScript are:<br>

setTimeout(function, milliseconds)<br>
Executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.<br>
setInterval(function, milliseconds)<br>
Same as setTimeout(), but repeats the execution of the function continuously.<br>
