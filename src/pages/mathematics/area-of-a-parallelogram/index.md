## Area of a Parallelogram

The area of a parallelogram is defined as: 

** A = b x h **

where b and h represent the base and height of the parallelogram, respectively 

Intuition: 
Every parallelogram can be made into a rectangle, which is why we use the same formula to find the area of a parallelogram and a rectangle.
