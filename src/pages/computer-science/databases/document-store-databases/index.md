## Document Store Databases
A document store database is considered to be yet another type of NoSQL database that is very similar to a Key Value database. A record in a document store represents a single structured document that can be different from all other documents in the database. Unlike a relational database, there is no mapping of objects to various table in the database. Instead we can take the entire object and write it directly into a document store database.

For example, we could have the following object inside of our code.

```json
{
    "name": "freeCodeCamp",
    "job": "contributor"
}
```

This entire object can be written directly into a document store database without further parsing.
