The style tag is used sort of like a css file except inside of an HTML, like so:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Your Title</title>
    <style> <-- Here
      p {
        color:red;
      }
    </style> <-- To here
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is content</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

That would make the paragraph tag's color red. It is kind of useful if you just want to put a little bit of code, but if you want a really long stylesheet, then I recommend just using ```<link />```.
