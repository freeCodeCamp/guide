## Scrum

Scrum is one of the methodologies under the Agile umbrella. 
The practice revolves around 
- A set of roles (delivery team, product owner, and scrum master)
- Ceremonies (sprint planning, daily standup, sprint review, sprint retrospective, and backlog grooming)
- Artifacts (product backlog, sprint backlog, product increment, and info radiators and reports).
- The main goal is to keep the team aligned on project progress to facilitate rapid iteration.
