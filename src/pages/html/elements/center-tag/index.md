## Center Tag

To center-align text on your page you can use the **`<center>`** tag.
  ```html
  <center>Text to align</center>
  ```
  
  This tag is only used to align text and is not supported in HTML5 anymore.
  <center> is rendered correctly in every major browser.
  
  It is recommended to use CSS to align elements instead of this tag.
