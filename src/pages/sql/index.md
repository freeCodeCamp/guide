## SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the most common tool used to manipulate data in a relational database (often referred to as a "SQL database").

SQL is commonly pronounced "sequel." Its most popular variants are MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite - a version of SQL which is commonly used for prototyping.
