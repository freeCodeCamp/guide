## Proxies

A proxy server is a dedicated computer or a software system running on a computer that acts as an intermediary between an endpoint device, such as a computer, and another server from which a user or client is requesting a service. The proxy server may exist in the same machine as a firewall server or it may be on a separate server, which forwards requests through the firewall.

Their are different types of proxies which include but are not limited to:
<ul>
 	<li>Forward Proxies</li>
 	<li>Reverse Proxies</li>
 	<li>Transparent Proxies</li>
 	<li>Web Proxies</li>
</ul>
The most commonly known one's today are web proxies which act as an intermediary between a user's computer and the internet.

The common features of such proxies are:
<ul>
 	<li>To hide a user's IP address providing anonymity while surfing the web.</li>
 	<li>Â Enabling users to access sites with blocked IP addresses.</li>
</ul>

An advantage of a proxy server is that its cache can serve all users. If one or more Internet sites are frequently requested, these are likely to be in the proxy's cache, which will improve user response time. A proxy can also log its interactions, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.
