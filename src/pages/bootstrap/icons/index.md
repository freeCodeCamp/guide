To use bootstrap icons you simply create `<span>` tag and apply the applicable CSS class for the icon. A code example has been provided below.

**Code Example:**

`<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search" aria-hidden="true"></span>`

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search" aria-hidden="true"></span>


This is an example of the CSS classes that bootstrap provides for glyphicons. More of them is avalible <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#glyphicons' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>here</a>

`.glyphicon glyphicon-plus` This is bootstrap's plus/add icon.

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus" aria-hidden="true"></span>

`.glyphicon glyphicon-trash` This is bootstrap's trash/delete icon.

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-trash" aria-hidden="true"></span>
