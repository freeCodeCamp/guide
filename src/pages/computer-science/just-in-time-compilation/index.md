## Just in Time Compilation

Just In Time Compilation, JIT, or Dynamic Translation, is compilation that is being done during the execution of a program. Meaning, at run time, as opposed to prior to execution. What happens is the translation to machine code. The advantages of a JIT are due to the fact, that since the compilation takes place in run time, a JIT compiler has access to dynamic runtime information enabling it to make better optimizations (such as inlining functions).

What is important to understand about the JIT compilation, is that it will compile the bytecode into machine code instructions of the running machine. Meaning, that the resulting machine code is optimized for the running machine's CPU architecture.

Two examples of JIT Compilers are : JVM (Java Virtual Machine) in Java and CLR (Common Language Runtime), in C#.
