## Software Engineering

The field of **software engineering** is the study of techniques and strategies
in order to efficiently manage the entire life cycle of software development.

If you are writing just scripts that might be used once or twice, implementing
software engineering principles may be too involved. However, as software
projects get larger and foresee future ongoing use, principles of software
engineering become increasingly important.

The entire life cycle of software development ranges from the creation of ideas
and design of the software to maintenance of the developed software over time.

You might think of software engineering as just how do you code up something and
keep it going. However, an important aspect of software engineering you might
not think about is the ethical practice of software development.

In this age where software can be used maliciously to steal information or do
harm if software is implemented incorrectly, software engineers (or
practitioners) must be aware of their duties to ethically develop software.
