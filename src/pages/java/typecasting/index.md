## Typecasting
Converting one data type to another data type is known as type casting. Since 
Java is an Object Oriented programming language and supports both **Inheritance** and **Polymorphism**, Itâ€™s easy that super class reference variable is pointing to subClass object. 

When we assign value of one data type to another, the two types might not be compatible with each other. If the data types are compatible, then JVM  will perform the conversion automatically known as automatic type conversion and if not then they need to be casted or converted explicitly.
### Types of Typecasting
Java, type casting is classified into two types.

***1.  Implicit Typecasting***
Here, Automatic Type casting take place when the two types are compatible
the target type is larger than the source type.
eg.
``` java
      int i = 100;
      long l = i;	//no explicit type casting required
      float f = l;	//no explicit type casting required
```
***2.  Explicit Typecasting***
When we assign a larger type value to a variable of smaller type, then we need to perform explicit type casting.
eg.
```java
      double d = 100.04;
      long l = (long)d;  //explicit type casting required
      int i = (int)l;	//explicit type casting required
```
