Next, copy the url for it. For example, if you’ve forked the freeCodeCamp guides repository, the url looks like <code>https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/guides.git</code>.</p>\n<p>In the command line on your local machine, navigate to where you want to save the project in your working directory. Finally, run the <code>git clone</code> command:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-shell"><code>git clone URL-OF-REPOSITORY</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>The default name of the new directory on your computer is the name of the repository, but you can change this by including the last (optional) parameter:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-shell"><code>git clone URL-OF-REPOSITORY NAME-OF-DIRECTORY-ON-COMPUTER</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Git gives the remote the alias “origin”. This is a useful way to refer to the remote when you want to push your changes to the remote server, or pull changes from it. See <a href=\'https://guide.freecodecamp.org/git/git-push/\' target=\'_blank\' rel=\'nofollow\'>Git push</a> and <a href=\'https://guide.freecodecamp.org/git/git-pull/\' target=\'_blank\' rel=\'nofollow\'>Git pull</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>Git only pulls the remote’s main branch onto your computer. This branch is usually named “master” by convention, but may be defined differently depending on the project.</p>\n<p>Also, Git automatically sets up your local main branch to track the remote branch. When you run <code>git status</code>, you’ll see information about whether your local branch is up-to-date with the remote. Here’s an example output:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-shell"><code>myCommandPrompt (master) >> git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with \'origin/master\'.\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\nmyCommandPrompt (master) >></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>If your local <code>master</code> branch has three commits that you haven’t pushed up to the remote server yet, the status would say “Your branch is ahead of ‘origin/master’ by 3 commits.”</p>\n<h3>Git Clone Mirror</h3>\n<p>If you want to host mirror of a repository you can use mirror parameter. </p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-shell"><code>git clone URL-OF-REPOSITORY --mirror</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>After mirroring repository you can clone your local mirror from your server.</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-shell"><code>git clone NAME-OF-DIRECTORY-ON-COMPUTER</code></pre>\n      </div>',fields:{slug:"/git/git-clone/"},frontmatter:{title:"Git Clone"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/git/git-clone/"}}}});
