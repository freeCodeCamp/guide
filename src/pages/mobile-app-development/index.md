iOS App using XCode / Objective-C etc. 
- Development Costs & Effort is Higher

Hybrid App Definition

- Uses Native Device's Browser container to contain HTML5 App.
- Developing hybrid app is consistent, cross platform UI.

Hybrid apps take least amount of time & money to develop compared to native app. 
One code for both platforms.

### Apache Cordova

Apache Cordova is the wrapper that wraps your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a buildable mobile package, acting as the magic that glues everything together and turns it into a mobile app

### Ionic Framework

Ionic Framework is a CSS framework that allows you to style your screens to look mobile friendly, essentially acting as bootstrap but for mobile apps while developing using web technologies.

### React Native

React Native is a front end development framework that contains a lot of the building block elements for Android/iOS development and is a different kind of magic from Apache Cordova
