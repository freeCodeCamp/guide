## Rust

Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency. It maintains these goals without having a garbage collector, making it a useful language for a number of use cases other languages arenâ€™t good at: embedding in other languages, programs with specific space and time requirements, and writing low-level code, like device drivers and operating systems.
