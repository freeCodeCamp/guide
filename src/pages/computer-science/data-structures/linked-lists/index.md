## Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure which consists of a group of nodes in a sequence. Each node consists of two parts - its own data and the address of the next node. This structure forms a chain. Linked lists can be chained together in different ways and form more complex data structures.

### Types of Linked Lists
1. Single Linked Lists
They contain nodes which have a data part, and a pointer to the next node. Operations which can be performed on singly linked lists are insertion, deletion & traversal.
2. Doubly Linked Lists
Nodes in this type of list contain 3 parts - a pointer to the previous node, a pointer to the next node and its own data.
3. Circular Linked Lists
In this type of list the last node of the list has a pointer to the first node in the list - forming a circular chain.

The advantage of using linked lists over arrays are that nodes can be added as the need arises. They are not static in size like arrays. The disadvantage of using linked lists is that it takes longer to access a single element as you must traverse the entire list.
