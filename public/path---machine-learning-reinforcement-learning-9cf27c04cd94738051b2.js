It gives a nice gradual learning and can simplify the learning of agent in tasks where you cannot determine a proper error value.</p>\n<p>Example:\nA bot is given task to play Space Invaders, it tries to learn to play it by interacting with game and in return getting a reward for the points that it scored at end of game. Greater the reward, greater are its chances of doing the similar gameplay.</p>\n<p>In industries robot uses deep reinforcement learning to pick a device from one box and putting it in a container. Whether it succeeds or fails, it memorizes the object and gains knowledge and train’s itself to do this job with great speed and precision. Learning on its own is a kind of reinforcement learning provided the learning is in positive dimension.</p>',fields:{slug:"/machine-learning/reinforcement-learning/"},frontmatter:{title:"Reinforcement Learning"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/machine-learning/reinforcement-learning/"}}}});
