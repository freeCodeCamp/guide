## Scrummasters

A Scrum team is made up of 3 different roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and team members.

The Scrum Master's role is wide and varied. Some of their responsibilities are to coach the team in scrum, run or facilitate the various ceremonies (eg. stand ups), protect the team from the Product Owner or the wider business, and to facilitate in removing blockers from the team.
