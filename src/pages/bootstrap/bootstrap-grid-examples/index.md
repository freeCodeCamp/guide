## Bootstrap Grid Examples

Below we have collected some examples of basic Bootstrap grid layouts.

## The following example shows how to get a three equal-width columns starting at tablets and scaling to large desktops. On mobile phones, the columns will automatically stack:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4">.col-sm-4</div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">.col-sm-4</div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">.col-sm-4</div>
</div>

## The following example shows how to get a three various-width columns starting at tablets and scaling to large desktops:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-3">.col-sm-3</div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">.col-sm-6</div>
  <div class="col-sm-3">.col-sm-3</div>
</div>

## The following example shows how to get two various-width columns starting at tablets and scaling to large desktops:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4">.col-sm-4</div>
  <div class="col-sm-8">.col-sm-8</div>
</div>

## The following example shows how to get two columns starting at tablets and scaling to large desktops, with another two columns (equal widths) within the larger column (at mobile phones, these columns and their nested columns will stack):

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-8">
    .col-sm-8
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">.col-sm-6</div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">.col-sm-6</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">.col-sm-4</div>
</div>
