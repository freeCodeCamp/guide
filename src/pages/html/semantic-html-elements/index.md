## Semantic HTML Elements

Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

### Examples

Some examples of semantic HTML markup are ase follows:

* `<article>`
* `<aside>`
* `<details>`
* `<figcaption>`
* `<figure>`
* `<footer>`
* `<header>`
* `<main>`
* `<mark>`
* `<nav>`
* `<section>`
* `<summary>`
* `<time>`
