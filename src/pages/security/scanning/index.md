## Scanning

Description
Network scanning refers to a set of intelligence gathering procedures hackers perform to identify hosts, ports, and other vulnerabilities in a network. By finding such vulnerabilities, a hacker can create an accurate profile of the target organization. An ethical hacker is a person who attacks an organizationâ€™s security on behalf of its owners in order to discover vulnerabilities. Instead of taking advantage of these vulnerabilities, the ethical hacker reports them to the organization who can then put in place the appropriate countermeasures to protect themselves against malicious hackers.
