title: Idea of Semantic HTML Elements
---

Semantic element means element with meaning. Before Html5, programmer use to design the html template using div where they specify the class name(meaningful) of each div's like <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> etc. to make the script readable because without those class names it would be very difficult to understand which div is what partof page. To overcome this, the idea of semantic html came. 

“Semantic HTML” refers to the idea that all your HTML markup should convey the underlying meaning of your content—not its appearance. It provides a whole set of elements designed for the sole purpose of adding more meaning to the overall layout of a web page. Some example of semantic elements are <header>, <nav>, <aside>, <footer> etc. 

Using these as an alternative to <div> elements is an important aspect of modern web development because it makes it easier for search engines, screen readers, and other machines to identify the different parts of your website. It also helps you as a developer keep your site organized, which, in turn, makes it easier to maintain.
  
Below are the list of some Html5 semantic elements.

<article> - The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.
<aside> - The <aside> element defines some content aside from the page content it is placed in (like a sidebar).
<details> - Defines additional details that the user can view or hide
<figcaption> - Defines a caption for a <figure> element
<figure> - Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or section
<header> - Specifies a header for a document or section
<main> - Specifies the main content of a document
<mark> - Defines marked/highlighted text
<nav> - Defines navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<summary> - Defines a visible heading for a <details> element
<time> - Defines a date/time
