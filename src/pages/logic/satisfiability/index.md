## Satisfiability

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->

A formula P is considered **satisfiable** if it is **sometimes** true for some assignment of true/false to the variables.

Example:
  - x ^ y : is Satisfiable with x = T, y = T
  - x v y -> x : is Satisfiable with x = T, y = F
  
If there are no assignments, then it is considered Unsatisfiable.
