## What is Semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML tags were introduced in HTML5, as way to make your HTML markup more readable and accessible.

Prior to using semantic HTML, everything was a div or a span, which still accomplishes the task but makes things harder than necessary to read and understand.

The new semantic tags give an easily understandable structure to the page.

## What are the new Semantic HTML tags?

There are several, and as you'll see, you will know almost immediately how they should be used just from their names:

* article
* aside
* details
* figcaption
* figure
* footer
* header
* main
* mark
* nav
* section
* summary
* time

This handy image from W3Schools gives you an example of how some of the above tags may be used:
