## CSS3 Backgrounds

CSS3 contains a few new background properties, which allow greater control of the background element.
Firstly, CSS3 allows you to add multiple background images for an element, through the `background-image` property.
The different background images are separated by commas, and the images are stacked on top of each other, where the first image is closest to the viewer.
Moreover, there are a few more new CSS# Background properties:
* background-size
* background-origin
* background-clip
