## What is SAS?

Statistical Analysis Software or SAS is a  statistical programming lanuage, used mainly for the transformation, analysis and visualisation
of traditional enterprise data sources. Its focus is on simple data manipulation with built in statistical functions to enable advanced
modelling.

As a licensed product, SAS is often found in large enterprises as a go-to tool for those working in data and analytics. Importantly for
university graduates and those searching for work in industry who have focused on open source tools, it can be surprising to find 
companies using tools such as SAS.

Whilst SAS does not benefit from the same breadth and pace of development as open source languages such as R and Python, it does have
strong base libraries for sourcing data, manipulating it, and building models.  

With a focus on simple syntax and common programming principles such as conditional statements and functional programming, SAS 
is fairly easy to pick up and quite powerful since most enterprises have often purchased the physical analytics server space to go with
it. 

## What are some uses for SAS? 

- Automating ETL processes 

- Strong libraries for traditional statistical analysis

## What are some of its weaknesses?

- Lags behind other languages in variety of data visualisation packages

- Lacks support for newer machine learning and AI models when compared to open source libraries.

## Why should you use it?

- If you're looking for work in an industry with legacy systems, it may be worth familiarising yourself with SAS, companies may
  be looking for candidates that are familiar with enterprise software.
