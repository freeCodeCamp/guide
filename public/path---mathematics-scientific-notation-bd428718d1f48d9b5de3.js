The digit term must be a number between 1 and 10. The exponential term contains the placeholder zeros and locates where the decimal is placed. If the exponential term has a negative exponent, that means that the number is smaller than one, and that the decimal point must be moved a certain number of spaces to the left. Whereas a positive exponential number means that the number is very large and the decimal point must be moved to the right.</p>\n<h4>Example:</h4>\n<p>545,000,000,000 written in scientific notation: 5.45 x 10^11</p>\n<p>0.0000000000030435 = 3.0435 x 10^-12</p>\n<p>10 = 1.0 x 10^1</p>\n<p>1 = 1.0 x 10^0</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.chem.tamu.edu/class/fyp/mathrev/mr-scnot.html">Great article including arithmetic in scientific notation</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation">wikipedia article</a></li>\n</ul>',fields:{slug:"/mathematics/scientific-notation/"},frontmatter:{title:"Scientific Notation"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/mathematics/scientific-notation/"}}}});
