Here you can find various commands that help explain the methodology behind Vi.

## Modes
Most likely you'll find yourself in "normal" mode, it allows you to enter commands using the colon `:` key.
To get here from other modes you can type `ctrl + c` or `escape`.

To edit text and move around in a way you may be familiar with press `i`, for "insert" mode.
Depending on the configuration of settings you may be able to move around with the arrow keys in "insert" mode.

Likewise, depending on the configuration, you may enter a file browser by typing and entering the command `:e .` in "normal" mode. The 'e' stands for edit, and the period for the file or directory.
