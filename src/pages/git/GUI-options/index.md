# GUI Options for GitHub

Most people prefer to use Git as a [CLI (command-line interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) tool, but there are plenty of [GUI (graphical user interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) tools allowing you to use Git in a graphical way. GUI tools can useful to get a better view of the state of your Git repository, and some might find them easier to use than the CLI. However, knowing how to use the CLI is highly recommended because it will be the same interface on every platform, because it is generally considered to be more efficient, and because it is required as soon as you want to do something even a little bit complex.
