## Coordinate Plane

A coordinate plane is a plane in which a coordinate system exists, such that all points in the plane can be unique determined by an order tuple (most commonly a pair). A coordinate plane, as with a coordinate system in any number of dimensions, helps to transform problems in geometry to problems in algebra, and vice versa.
