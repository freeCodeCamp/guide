title: The Agile Manifesto

### For Agile Software Development

Agile development was written in 2001 by a group of 17 software experts that included the creators of Scrum Extreme Programming (XP), Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), and Crystal; a representative of feature-driven development; and several other thought leaders in the software industry. The Agile Manifesto established a common set of overarching values and principles for all of the individual agile methodologies at the time. This is that manifesto.

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.Through this work we have come to value:

1.  Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
2.  Working software over comprehensive documentation
3.  Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4.  Responding to change over following a plan

> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
