# Supplementary Angles

## Definition

Two angles which sum up to 180&deg;, are called supplementary angles.

Supplementary angles don't have to be next to each other, just so long as the total is 180&deg;.

### For example :

As `a` is parallel to `b`, <b>angles</b> "`3`" and "`6`" sum up to 180&deg;. Hence, they are supplementary angles.
