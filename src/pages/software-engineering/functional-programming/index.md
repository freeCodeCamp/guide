## Functional Programming

Functional programming is the process of building software by composing **pure functions**, avoiding **shared state**, **mutable data**, and **side-effects**. Functional programming is **declarative** (telling the computer what you want to do) rather than **imperative** (telling the computer exactly how to do that), and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast it with object-oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.

### Why Functional Programming?

* It's generally more concise
* It's generally more predictable
* It's easier to test than object-oriented code

### Adoption by Programing Languages

Many programming languages support functional programming like Haskell, F#, Common Lisp, Clojure, Erlang, OCaml. JavaScript also has the properties of an untyped functional language.

### Uses

Functional programming has long been popular in academia, but with few industrial applications. However, recently several prominent functional programming languages have been used in commercial or industrial systems. For example, the Erlang programming language, which was developed by the Swedish company Ericsson in the late 1980s, is used for building a range of applications at companies such as T-Mobile, Nortel, Facebook, Électricité de France and WhatsApp.
