## Open Source

Open source software is any type of software that is available to the public to see or to be downloaded for free. Anyone is capable of creating a open source project.

Open source projects are legally made open through a creative license. They are changed, maintained or abandoned by their creators at any time. Many open source projects have contributors that volunteer to add and edit code.

In short, the Open source softwares are of **lower cost**, **higher security** and **better quality** when compared to propreitary softwares.
