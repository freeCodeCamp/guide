## Array Length

`length` is a property of arrays in JavaScript that returns or sets the number of elements in a given array.

The `length` property of an array can be returned like so.

```
let desserts = ["Cake", "Pie", "Brownies"]
desserts.length
// returns 3
```
The assignment operator, in conjunction with the `length` property, can be used to set then number of elements in an array like so.

```
let cars = ["Saab", "BMW", "Volvo"]
cars.length = 2
// returns 2
```
