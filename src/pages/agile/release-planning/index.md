## Release Planning

The purpose of release planning is to commit to a plan for delivering an increment of product value.  The goal of initial release planning is to estimate roughly which features will be delivered by the release deadline (presuming the deadline is fixed), or to choose a rough delivery date for a given set of features (if the scope is fixed). 

Releases typically range between 2 and 12 months. For longer releases, it may make sense to break it down into several sub-releases.

Release planning is a collaborative effort involving these roles:

- Scrum master – Facilitates the meeting
- Product owner – Represents a general view of the product backlog
- Delivery team or agile team – Provide insights into technical feasibility and dependencies
- Stakeholders – Act as trusted advisors as decisions are made around the release plan
