The freeCodeCamp community is building a massive, searchable **"Guide"**.

This reference tool will eventually include thousands of articles that cover all areas of development, design, and data science - all written to be easily understood by people new to coding.

This repo is where we plan and maintain these Guide articles, which we then host on our community's wiki-like Guide website at [`guide.freecodecamp.org`](https://guide.freecodecamp.org).

## What are Guide articles?

The Guide articles aim to be short articles to get you started and familiar with these concepts before going on to read more in-depth material.

Guide articles can be an explanation of a syntax, design pattern, what aria labels are for, or something like what the numbers mean in the top right-hand corner of your screen when at [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org).

You can find an [example article about HTML Elements here](./src/pages/html/elements/index.md).

## What can I write an article about?

We welcome your help writing these articles. You don't have to be an expert in a topic to write about it - this entire Guide is open source, so even if you make a mistake, another contributor will eventually correct it.

To help, find a `stub article` on our [Guide website](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/), write the article, then open a pull request (PR) to replace the stub with your article.

If you can't find a stub about the topic you'd like to write about, you can open a PR that creates the stub and includes your draft article. Feel free to ask us questions if you're not sure where to put a new article in the directory structure.

Before you begin writing, make sure to read the [article style guide](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/guides/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#article-style-guide) below.
