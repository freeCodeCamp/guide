## Framer

<p align="justify">
Framer is a design tool for the Mac which allows you to design without limitations. It is based on Framer Library and offers the familiarity of visual editing with the flexibility of code. A seamless workflow, further complemented by device previewing, version control and easy sharing.
</p>

#### Framer Library

<p align="justify">
Framer Library is an open source JavaScript framework for high fidelity prototyping. Use it to design animations and interactions without any limitations. Make use of real spring physics or animate with 3D effects, anything is possible. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
There are 2 ways to use Framer Library. To get most out of Library download Framer; a design tool for the Mac. The other way you can leverage Framer Library is with generator; an app that imports your layers from Sketch, Photoshop and Figma. The following features are included with each option. 
</p>

Although, Framer Studio is a prototyping application for Mac, but Framer.js only needs Safari or Chrome.

<p align="justify">
No dragging and dropping, pushing buttons, or connecting dots here — in Framer you will have to code. Programmers will feel at home, designers maybe less so. But it’s not too hard — Framer Studio uses a simplified version of JavaScript: CoffeeScript. But the fact that the actual engine (Framer.js) uses JavaScript makes for a lot of possibilities: you can do everything that’s possible in a web browser, so you can connect to servers to use live data, or create a Twitter client that shows real-time tweets.
</p>

##### Pros

<p align="justify">
Integration with Sketch or Photoshop is as good as it gets: you can refer to layers or objects by the names you gave them while designing. (Framer.js has a Framer Generator Mac application included that does the same trick.)
Anything that is possible with JavaScript — like using live data from web services, or using the accelerometer — is also possible in Framer.
</p>

##### Cons

<p align="justify">
You’ll have to write code for everything, for every animation or interaction. You’ll need to be or get acquainted with CoffeeScript, maybe also JavaScript.
