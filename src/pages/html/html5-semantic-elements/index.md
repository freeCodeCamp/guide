## HTML5 Semantic Elements

HTML5 semantic elements are those elements that introduce meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. According to the definition of W3C, “a semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer”.

Some examples of semantic HTML elements include elements such as blockquote, em, strong, code etc.

The benefits of using semantic elements are more searchable content leading to better search engine ranking.

Below is an example of usage of HTML5 semantic elements.

```html

<body>
 
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>Here goes your main text.</p>
  </header>
   
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
      <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
   
  <article>
     
    <section>
      <h3>This is a logical part</h3>
      <p>Paragraph 1</p>
      <p>Paragraph 2</p>
    </section>
   
  </article>
   
  <footer>
    <ul>
      <li>Copyright</li>
      <li>xxxxxxxxx</li>
    </ul>
  </footer>
 
</body>
