## What are progressive web apps?

They appear to be not just a new fad, but a fudamentally different way of approaching what a website can and should be on whatever platform you are viewing it from.



Specifically Progressive web apps are:

* Responsive: to fit any form factor
* Connectivity independent: Progressively-enhanced with Service Workers to let them work offline
* App-like-interactions: Adopt a Shell + Content application model to create appy navigations & interactions
* Fresh: Transparently always up-to-date thanks to the Service Worker update process
* Safe: Served via TLS (a Service Worker requirement) to prevent snooping
* Discoverable: Are identifiable as “applications” thanks to W3C Manifests and Service Worker registration scope allowing search engines to find them
* Re-engageable: Can access the re-engagement UIs of the OS; e.g. Push Notifications
* Installable: to the home screen through browser-provided prompts, allowing users to “keep” apps they find most useful without the hassle of an app store
* Linkable: meaning they’re zero-friction, zero-install, and easy to share. The social power of URLs matters.

These apps aren’t packaged and deployed through stores, they’re just websites that took all the right vitamins.
