# One-Shot Learning

Humans learn new concepts with very little supervision – e.g. a child can generalize the concept
of “monkey” from a single picture in a book – yet our best deep learning systems need hundreds or
thousands of examples. This motivates the setting we are interested in: “one-shot” learning, which
consists of learning a class from a single (or very few) labelled example.

There are various approaches to One-Shot learning such as [similarity functions](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/one-shot-learning-gjckG), 
[Bayes' probability theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIjy3lV_KJU), DeepMind has come up with it's own version of Neural Networks using the One-Shot learning approach!
