## Fractional Exponents

Fractional Exponents are used to raise a number to an exponent that is not a whole number.  If you have worked with exponents and square roots before, you have already done fractional exponents before.  For example, the square root of 3 is the same as saying 3 to the 1/2.

Knowing that any whole number can be represented as a fractionwith a denomenator of one, raising anything to n/1 is the same thing as raising that number to n.  Putting the two together, we can write the general formula of fractonal exponents as:

**Note: It doesn't matter which you do first, the numerator or denomenator**

Here is an example:
