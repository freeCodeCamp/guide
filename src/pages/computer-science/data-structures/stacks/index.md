## Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the elements are accessed. The order of operations may either be Last In First Out (LIFO) or First In First Out (FIFO). An example of LIFO is a stack of dishes waiting to be washed. The dish which is put on last will be the first one picked up to be washed.

There are a few basic operations which can be performed on a stack:
1. Push: Add's an item to the top of a stack, if it is not full
2. Pop: Removes an item from the top of the stack, if it is not empty
3. isEmpty: Returns true if the stack is empty, else false
4. Peek: Returns the top element of the stack, without removing it
