## Use the align-items Property in the Tweet Embed

Similar to the  <a href='https://github.com/freecodecamp/guides/tree/master/src/pages/certifications/responsive-web-design/css-flexbox/align-elements-using-the-align-items-property/index.md' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>previous challenge</a>, you will need to set the property value to `center` on the right selector.
