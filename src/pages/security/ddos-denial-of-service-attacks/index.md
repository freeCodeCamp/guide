## Denial of Service Attacks

Denial-of-Service attacks are cyber-attacks aiming to block the use of a website or service by its intended users.
The attacker is spamming the server with excessive requests over time hoping to overload the systems to prevent them
from serving information to actual users of that website/service.

## Distributed Denial of Service Attacks
Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks are working in the same way with one big difference.
Instead of using just one IP the attack is performed by multiple hosts (these could be hacked computers) wich will
result in a stronger and often long-lasting attack.

The collected hosts mentioned above are most likely part of bigger networks (Botnets) controlling all infected hosts.
Theses worldwide networks are hard to stop since they don't neccessarily share the same ip wich you can block.
At first sight it may also appear that these different adresses are just normal users wich makes it hard to predict
when an actual DDoS-attack occurs.
