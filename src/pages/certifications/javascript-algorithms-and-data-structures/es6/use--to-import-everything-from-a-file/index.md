## Use * to Import Everything from a File

If you want to import everything possible from a file, then you use the `import * as _ from` syntax, provided by ES6. That's exactly what you're tasked at doing in this challenge!

## Hint 1:

Fill in the blanks: `import * as objName from "file-name"`. You can be creative with your `objName`, but your file name should be `capitalize_strings`.

## Spoiler Alert - Solution Ahead!

## Solution:

```javascript
"use strict";
import * as str from "capitalize_strings";
```
