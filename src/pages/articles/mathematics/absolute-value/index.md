## Absolute Value

You can think of a number's absolute value as its distance from zero.

Here you can see that in the graph of y = |x|, if -2 is input in to the function, 2 is the result. This is because -2 has a distance of 2 from zero.

### Examples

* **Simplify |-5|**

  |-5| = 5

* **Simplify |0(5)|**

  |0(5)| = |0| = 0

* **Simplify -|-1|**

  -|-1| = -|1| = -1

* **Simplify |-5(-3) + 1|**

  |-5(-3) + 1| = |15 + 1| = |16| = 16

* **Simplify |8|**

  |8| = 8
