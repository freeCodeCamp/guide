In quantum computing, a qubit or quantum bit (sometimes qbit) is a unit of quantum informationâ€”the quantum analogue of the classical bit. In a classical system, a bit would have to be in one state or the other. However, quantum mechanics allows the qubit to be in a superposition of both states at the same time, a property that is fundamental to quantum computing.
