## Code Smells

Code smells, or bad smells in code, are initial indicators that there may deeper problems with the source code<sup>1</sup>. Eg "This code smells funny", or "There is a bad smell coming from this code".

The term was originally coined by Kent Beck when working with Martin Fowler on the book "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"<sup>2</sup>.

The term "smell" is used as bad smells are distinctive and therefore easy to sniff out<sup>3</sup>.
