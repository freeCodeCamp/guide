<h1>Adobe InDesign</h1>

Adobe InDesign is an Adobe desktop software optimized for designing print materials, including flyers, posters, business cards and letterheads, brochures, and books. 

<h2>Summary</h2> 
InDesign differs from other text-manipulating software due to its use of a master-page system, in which design elements can be controlled over a large number of pages. Using the initial master page, known as A-master, one can place a decorative border or glyph on a single page and have it repeated exactly over hundreds of subsequent pages. Additional master pages can be created for different use cases.
