## Use an Array to Store a Collection of Data

### Problem explanation:
Assign an array of at least 5 elements in length to `yourArray`. Your array should contain at least one string, one number, and one boolean.

#### Hint
Remember to enclose your strings in `""` and to delimit the items in your Array with `,`.

## Spoiler alert!

**Solution ahead!**

```javascript
let yourArray = [true, 'hello', 1, 2, 3];

```
