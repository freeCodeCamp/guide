## Motherboard

The motherboard is the connecting layer that allows a computer's components to interact with each other. The motherboard typically has connections for random access memory (RAM), a hard drive, a graphics processing unit (GPU), and a central processing unit (CPU). In desktops, the motherboard is a physical board to which all of these components are connected. However, in laptops, the motherboard typically has some of these components integrated due to the space constraints of laptops.

A motherboard provides power and connectivity to the computer's components, and acts as the switchboard for all inter-component communications. If the CPU needs to process information that is stored in RAM, for example, the motherboard provides a connection between the CPU and RAM, called the memory bus, to allow for data access. A motherboard includes buses for expansion cards (including the GPU), RAM, and hard drives.

Parts of a Motherboard

If you were to open up your computer and take out the motherboard, you would probably get pretty confused about all the different parts. Depending on the make and model of your computer, it might look something like this.
To understand how computers work, you don't need to know every single part of the motherboard. However, it is good to know some of the more important parts and how the motherboard connects the various parts of a computer system together. Here are some of the typical parts:

- A CPU socket - the actual CPU is directly soldered onto the socket. Since high speed CPUs generate a lot of heat, there are heat sinks and mounting points for fans right next to the CPU socket.
- A power connector to distribute power to the CPU and other components.
- Slots for the system's main memory, typically in the form of DRAM chips.
- A chip forms an interface between the CPU, the main memory and other components. On many types of motherboards, this is referred to as the Northbridge. This chip also contains a large heat sink.
- A second chip controls the input and output (I/O) functions. It is not connected directly to the CPU but to the Northbridge. This I/O controller is referred to as the Southbridge. The Northbridge and Southbridge combined are referred to as the chipset.
- Several connectors, which provide the physical interface between input and output devices and the motherboard. The Southbridge handles these connections.
- Slots for one or more hard drives to store files. The most common types of connections are Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) and Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA).
- A read-only memory (ROM) chip, which contains the firmware, or startup instructions for the computer system. This is also called the BIOS.
- A slot for a video or graphics card. There are a number of different types of slots, including the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) and Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe).
Additional slots to connect hardware in the form of Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) slots.

##Worlds cheapest Mother board Computer: [Rapsberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
![Raspberry pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2017/05/Raspberry-Pi-3-462x322.jpg)
Raspberry pi is world's smallest and most cheapest single board computer, the whole computer is as small as to a size of a credit card. In this ARM based computer whole system is encompassed on a credit card sized silicon board including its USB ports,HDMI port,SD card slot,Ethernet, Audio output,GPIO Pins And a Broadcom Soc consisting of an octacore 64 bit processer clocked at- along with its video core 4 GPU and a 1GB of LPDRAM.In this single board computer you also get a get two special ports for its own screens and cameras. Most amazing thing about this board is that its just a simple mother board which is a complete most affordable computing solution and a development machine too.It completely Open source and is powered by raspberry pi foundation and runs open sourced Raspbian,Ubuntu MATE and various other operating system.Raspberry pi is a perfect example of moor's law showing how cheaper,effecient and powerfull mother boards have become.
