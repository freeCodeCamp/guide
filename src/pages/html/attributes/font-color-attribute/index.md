## Font Color Attribute

The `<font color>` attribute specifies the color of text.
```
<font color="#42F45F">Learn programming with FreeCodeCamp!</font>
```
**Note:** The `<font color>` attribute is not supported in HTML5. Instead, use CSS `color` property. However, major browsers still continue to support this attribute.
