The HTML5 <audio> element specifies a standard way to embed audio in a web page.

## How It Works
The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.
  
 ## Attributes
 
 autoplay - the audio will automatically begin playback as soon as it can do so, without waiting for the entire audio file to finish downloading.
 
 loop - A Boolean attribute: if specified, will automatically seek back to the start upon reaching the end of the audio.
 
 muted - A Boolean attribute which indicates whether the audio will be initially silenced. Its default value is false.
 
 src - The URL of the audio to embed.
