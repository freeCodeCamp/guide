## Scrummasters

   A scrum master is the facilitator for an agile development team. Scrum is a methodology that allows a team to self-organize and make changes quickly, in accordance with agile principles.The ScrumMaster does anything possible to help the team perform at their highest level. This involves removing any impediments to progress, facilitating meetings, and doing things like working with the product owner to make sure the product backlog is in good shape and ready for the next sprint. The ScrumMaster role is commonly filled by a former project manager or a technical team leader but can be anyone.
     The scrum master manages the process for how information is exchanged.In product development, team members huddle together each morning for a stand-up meeting where they review progress and essentially restart the project.During the daily meetings, which are sometimes called "scrums," the scrum master asks the team members these three questions: 

1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What will you do today?
3. Are there any impediments in your way?

      Although the title of scrum master sounds powerful, the scrum master is not the project leader and is not held accountable for outcomes. The team as a whole is responsible for outcomes.
