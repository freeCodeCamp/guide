The :hover selector is used to select elements when you mouse over them.

The :hover selector can be used on all elements, not only on links.

Use the :link selector to style links to unvisited pages, the :visited selector to style links to visited pages, and the :active selector to style the active link.

Note: :hover MUST come after :link and :visited (if they are present) in the CSS definition, in order to be effective!

CSS Syntax
:hover {
    css declarations;
}
