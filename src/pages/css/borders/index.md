## Border Property

The `border` shorthand property sets all the border properties in one declaration. 
```css 
  border: 1px solid #000;
```

The properties that can be set, are (in order): 
1. `border-width`
2. `border-style`
3. `border-color`

It does not matter if one of the values above are missing, for example:

```css 
  border: solid red;
```
The above code is also valid CSS.

### Border Styles

The 'border-style' property sets a wide range of different types of borders.

The various values are:
- 'dotted' - Sets a dotted border.
- 'dashed' - Sets a dashed border.
- 'solid' - Sets a solid border.
- 'double' - Sets a double border.
- 'groove' - Sets a 3D grooved border. 
- 'ridge' - Sets a 3D ridged border. 
- 'inset' - Sets a 3D inset border. 
- 'outset' - Sets a 3D outset border.
- 'none' - Sets no border.
- 'hidden' - Sets a hidden border.

Based on the property you choose, these styles can be mismatched.
```css
  border-top-style: solid;
  border-left-style: dotted;
  border-right-style: dashed;
  border-bottom-style: double;
```
As shown, the border property allows you to select different sections of it. [top, bottom, left, right]

Another important `border`property is the `border-radius` property. This can either be declared in pixels or in percentage. The `border-radius` property adds rounded corners to elements,
