## Article

The Article tag is a semantic element of HTML5. The article element represents a section of content that forms an independent part of a document or site; for example, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry.

The functionality of an article tag is similar to a div element, and its display and styling work the same. However, using the article element instead of div provides more semantic information to screen readers, search engines, and third-party applications.

```html
<article>
    <h1>lorem Ipsum</h1>
    <p>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog ...</p>
    ...
</article>
```
