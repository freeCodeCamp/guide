When you are refining and sizing the User Stories in the backlog, the INVEST mnemonic can help you determine if they are ready

- Independent
  - The story is as distinct as possible from the other stories. Avoid "2-stories in one".
- Negotiable
  - As a part of the conversation between the Product Owner and the Delivery Team during grooming, the details for the story can be discussed, refined, and improved. The acceptance criteria can be adjusted based on the ebb and flow of customer need and technical capability.
- Valuable
  - There is a value to the customer. Money earned, time saved, efficiency gained, loss stopped, etc. by the implementation of the story.
- Estimable
  - During grooming, the description and conversation for the story have addressed enough of the questions from the Delivery Team that they can confidently and comfortably Size the story.
- Small
  - You can complete the story within the established iteration.
- Testable
  - The story includes acceptance criteria you will use to confirm that the code meets the customer's needs.
