# While Loop

**What does a While Loop do?**

* A while loop runs at least once. It is used when you don't know how many times it will take
to run through a loop.
* A while loop runs while a logical condition is true.
* The while statement is evaluated at the end of the loop. It is inside the parenthesis.

 -----------------------------------------------
  The general form of if statement:

 if (Test Condition is true )
  {
   // Block of statement
  }
  -----------------------------------------------
  
If the value of your test condition is ***true***, then the block of
code inside the while loop is executed.

If the value of your test condition is ***false***, then the block of
code inside the while loop is skipped and your code continues.

Example of a While loop:

  ---------------------------- -----------------------------

```cpp

  int num = 3
  while (num < 5 )
{
  // execute code of block
  num = num+1
}
  // program continues

```

In this example, the program will run once, when num = 3.
Then, num will increment to 4 and the condition will be tested again.
It remains true, so the code is run again.
num is then incremented to 5.
The test condition is tested, and is false (since 5 == 5, not 5 < 5).
The program skips the while loop and the rest of the program is run.

  ---------------------------- -----------------------------

Example in C++:

```cpp

// Program to show how a while loop works by incrementing numbers

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	// Declare and intialize programming variables
	int num = 7;

	// while loop to increment the number
	while (num < 11) {
		cout << "The current value of num is: " << num << endl;
		// increment num by 1
		num = num + 1;
	}

  //program continues
  cout << "That is how a while loop works." << endl;

  system("pause");
  return 0;
}
```

### Output

The current value of num is: 7
The current value of num is: 8
The current value of num is: 9
The current value of num is: 10
That is how a while loop works.
