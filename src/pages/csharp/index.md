## C#

C Sharp, more commonly referred to as "C#", is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. C# was developed by Anders Hejlsberg and his development team at Microsoft and is currently on version 7.0.

C# has its roots in the family of C languages. It inherits most of its feature from C, C++, and Java. For this reason, programmers familiar with C/C++/Java may be able to get up to speed with C# in a shorter timespan.

C# is an object-oriented language while also providing support for component-oriented programming.

#### Features of C# include:
1) Automatic Garbage Collection
2) Exceptional Handling
3) Type-safety
4) Versioning
5) Delegates
6) Properties
7) LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) and Lambda Expressions
8) Generics
9) Indexers

#### New Features Added on C# 7.0:
1) Deconstructors
2) New syntax to work with Tuples
3) Pattern Matching with Is Expressions
4) Local Functions
5) Return by Reference
6) Out Variables
7) Literal improvements
8) Generalized Async Return Types
9) More Expresion-Bodied Members
10) Throw Expressions

You can use C# to create Windows client applications, XML Web services, distributed components, client-server applications, database applications, and much more.

#### ASP.NET and .NET Applications
The C# language is also used with the ASP.NET framework, developed by Microsoft Corp., specifically for creating web applications that are machine and browser independent. The broader .NET framework, also developed by Microsoft, is used for creating other types of applications such as desktop, mobile, server, and networking applications. The .NET framework includes the .NET Base Class Libraries (BCL), ASP.NET, ADO.NET, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), and eXtensible Markup Language(XML) libraries.
