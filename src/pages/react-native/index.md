## React Native

React Native is a cross-platform tool for building JavaScript applications that can run outside of the browser — most commonly iOS and Android apps.

** React Native can be used to build applications on Windows devices, desktop OS’s, and Apple TV apps as well but this guide will only be covering it’s most common purpose — Android and iOS applications.

### What is React Native

React Native falls in-between native and hybrid applications on the mobile app spectrum. The user interface you create is entirely native and the overall application performance is nearly as good as writing a native app. It also gives you the flexibility to embed web views (webpages) or native code (Java/Kotlin for Android, Objective C/Swift for iOS) inside your applications wherever you want.

It follows the same pattern as React where the views (what you see on the screen) are rendered from the JavaScript files. The difference is that it supplies it’s own API for handling native mobile views vs the DOM on the web. If you are confused about how this works, follow this guide on freeCodeCamp and it will take you step by step through these concepts.

### Reasons to choose React Native

1. **Code reusability** — It uses one code based that is shared between both platforms.
1. **Reuse web tools and skills** — Reuse JavaScript knowledge and tools like Axios, Redux, and other libraries that don’t require the DOM from the web.
1. **Optimized for developer productivity** — Comes with features like hot/live reloading and chrome developer tools out of the box!
1. **Performance** — Performs better than hybrid application frameworks like Ionic and Cordova.
1. **Corporate backing** — Lot’s of companies support and contribute to React Native including Walmart, Airbnb, Wix, and, of course, Facebook.
1. **Community** — React Native has a large (and growing) community with over 1500 contributors to the core project and thousands more who contribute to various libraries.
1. **Better user experience** — React Native uses the JavaScript code to render native components from your phone's OS. In other words, the application's user interface (UI) is entirely native!
