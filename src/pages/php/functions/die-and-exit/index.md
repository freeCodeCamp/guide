## Die and Exit

The `die()` and `exit()` functions are identical. They each take one argument (a string) containing an error message. Upon being run they output the message and immediately halt execution of the script.

```PHP
<?php
die('Die() function was run');
```
```PHP
<?php
exit('Exit() function was run');
```
