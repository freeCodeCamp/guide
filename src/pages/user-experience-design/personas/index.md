## Personas

Personas are fictitious representations of the ideal users of a product. They are usually used to simulate user experience scenarios. With these simulations, key software or product features can be identified and implemented.  

With personas, you can understand your users ( and potential users) better. They also make it easier for you to tailor content to the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different groups.

Personas can be developed through market research, surveys and one-on-one customer interviews.
