## Case Studies

The Software Engineering Ethics Research Institute of the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at East Tenesee State University published a series of  Case Studies to help sensitize practicing software developers and students to the various types of ethical dilemmas they may face. [The International Standard for Professional Software 
Development and Ethical Responsibility](http://seeri.etsu.edu/TheSECode.htm) forms the basis for much of the analysis in each case.

Cases:

* [**Big Brother Spyware**](http://seeri.etsu.edu/SECodeCases/ethicsC/BigBrother.htm) – Raises the issues of the tension between privacy, security, and whistle blowing in a post 11 September environment.

* [**Computerized Patient Records**](http://seeri.etsu.edu/SECodeCases/ethicsC/Computerized%20Patient%20Records.htm) – The case uses patient records to examine the developer’s responsibility for information security. It evaluates a series of alternatives.

* [**Death By Wire**](http://seeri.etsu.edu/SECodeCases/ethicsC/DeathByWire.htm) – The case address issues that arise from the shift of control from mechanically based systems to purely electronic/computer systems. It explores a situation where this process has been extended to heavy vehicles. It also looks at what happens when control of safety critical equipments is turned over to a computer.

* [**Digital Wallets and Whistle Blowing**](http://seeri.etsu.edu/SECodeCases/ethicsC/DigitalWallets.htm) – This is based on a real case involving security and includes an analysis of the decision related to when and how to whistle blow.

* [**For Girls Only**](http://seeri.etsu.edu/SECodeCases/ethicsC/ForGirlsOnly.htm) – This case looks at a real case of gender bias in the development of software.

* [**Nano-Technology: Swallow That Chip**](http://seeri.etsu.edu/SECodeCases/ethicsC/NanoTechnology.htm) – This case uses the vehicle of nano-technology to explore ways to address privacy and security issues that face software developers...

* [**Patriot Missile Case**](http://seeri.etsu.edu/SECodeCases/ethicsC/PatriotMissile.htm) – This piece examines the importance of configuration management and effective design as they relate to the Patriot Missile Disaster.

* [**Therac-25**] (http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/Papers/THERAC25.html) – This case highlights the danger of software-based controls on life-threatening systems.
