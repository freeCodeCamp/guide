## Area of a Parallelogram

A parallelogram with base b and height h can be divided into a trapezoid and a right triangle, and rearranged into a rectangle. This means that the area of a parallelogram is the same as that of a rectangle with the same base and height:

`Area = b * h`

Another approach would be to use analytic algebra and define a parallelogram as a cross product.
With two adjacent walls `a` and `b` and an angle between them `x` we can apply formula:

`Area = a * b * sin(x)`
