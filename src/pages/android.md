#Android

Android is Google's answer to Apple's iOS operating system. Where Swift and Objective-C are the languages used to develop iOS apps, Android apps use Java.  Java has very similar syntax to the family of C-based programming languages, i.e. C, C#, C++, and even JavaScript.  If you can write loops and functions in one of these languages, you can develop Android apps.  Java recently added support for anonymous functions.  So called "lambda expressions". This functional style of programming is widespread in the JavaScript/web-development world.

Android Studio is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to develop Android apps.  An IDE is a text editor, debugger, syntax-checker, compiler, and lots of useful shortcuts all in one.  One extra feature that Android Studio (AS) does particularly well is its set of emulators.  Emulators exist because you want to see how your code looks and behaves across a swath of devices.  Android Studio alleviates having to own X different Droid devices with the emulator.  Android Studio sets the standard for comparing Java IDEs.

Each iteration of the Android operating system has a unique sweet-treat based nickname.  The latest version of Android is 8.0 or "Oreo".  Version 7.0 was "Marshmallow' and 6.0 was "Nougat".  When developing for Android, it may be tempting to use the latest shiny new features offered.  Though doing so will have a noticeable impact on the number of users who can use your app.  Try to develop apps using older versions to reach the largest possible audience.
