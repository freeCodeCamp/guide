## Utf 8 Reference
UTF-8 refers to the meta tag located inside the head of an HTML document and usually looking something like this `<meta charset="UTF-8">`. It tells the browser which character set the page is encoded in.

UTF 8 is an encoding scheme used to translate the characters we see on screens into numbers computers can store. 

The [Unicode](https://www.unicode.org/) standard was developed in order to accomodate the characters used in languages across the world. 

But wait! What does Unicode have to do with UTF 8? UTF 8 is the encoding scheme but it is important to understand Unicode is the character set definition. In plain speak what this means is Unicode defines a unique number - called a code point - for many major characters used in languages across the world and UTF 8 will translate (aka encode) the character into computer-friendly binary format. <sup>1</sup> Here is an example:

  1. You want to mention freeCodeCamp somewhere in your web page (because, you know, freeCodeCamp is ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥).
  2. The character code points to spell freeCodeCamp as defined in Unicode are:   

       | f | r | e | e | C | o | d | e | C | a | m | p |
       | :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |
       |102| 114| 101| 101|  67| 111| 100| 101|  67|  97| 109| 112|
  3. UTF 8 translates the code points to binary: 1100110 1110010 1100101 1100101 1000011 1101111 1100100 1100101 1000011 1100001 1101101 1110000  


### How to use UTF-8 In Your Webpage

Specify a meta tag with a charset of UTF 8 in your head tag.

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
```
