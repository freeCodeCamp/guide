## User Acceptance Tests

One of the final steps in software testing is user acceptance testing (UAT). UAT makes sure actual users can use the software. Also referred to as beta, application, and end-user testing. 

UAT checks that everything works properly and that there are no crashes. Those of the intended audience should complete the testing; this could be comprised of many people involved from the process and anyone who is able to test before going live.  The feedback from this testing is forwarded to the development team for any specific changes.

#### Why do we need UAT

* Requirement changes might not have communicated to the developers

* The software may not be delivering actually what it meant for

* Some logic or business process may need user's attention


#### What is required before we start UAT

* Complete requriement is signed off and is available as documented

* The code is in working or in demoable condition

* UAT is environment is ready for access

* There should not be any defect which will break the code

* Test data prepared in accordance with the LIVE scneario

#### Framework & tools used

* FitNesse
