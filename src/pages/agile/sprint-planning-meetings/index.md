## Sprint Planning Meetings

The **Sprint Planning Meeting** is the new starting line at the beginning of every Sprint. In this session, your Sprint Team (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Delivery Team) commit to complete a set of User Stories by the end of the Sprint.

The Product Owner (PO) is responsible for keeping the Product Backlog in priority order; thus your team is working on the most important items.

One or two sprint's worth of stories in the product backlog should be groomed and sized. Using the established Sprint Velocity and the estimates, it is relatively simple to identify how many stories can be added to the sprint backlog. An efficient team may have already added the tasks for each User Story. If your team has a "Definition of Ready" for the User Stories then, as a team rule, you should only be considering stories that meet this definition.
