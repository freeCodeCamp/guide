## MoSCoW
MoSCoW is the acronym of  "Must have," "Should have," "Could have," and "Won't have." 

It is a useful technique to prioritize the product backlog in a quick manner. Although the product owner would be responsible for this task, the scrum master/coach has to ensure the team understand and agree on the ranking.

* **Must have**  
These requirements are essential. Even one of these requirements cannot be delivered, the project delivery should be considered a failure.

* **Should have**  
Should have requirements are as important as Must have requirements. Tough they are often not as time-critical or there may be another way to meet the requirement.

* **Could have**  
Could have requirements are nice to have feature. They could improve user experience or customer satisfaction but are not necessary.

* **Won't have**  
These requirements are agreed not to deliver at the current stage but stakeholders would like to consider in future.
