## Sprint Planning Meetings

Sprint Planning Meetings take place at the beginning of each and every sprint. The goal is to define the work will be done in the forthcoming sprint, and how long it will take. Sprint Planning Meetings, often shortened to Planning Meetings or just Planning, are essential when working in an agile setting.

All members of the agile team should attend the planning meeting and have some input. The meeting is typically lead and facilitated by a Scrum Master.

At the start of the meeting, or before, the team's available time is determined. This is often known as the team's "capacity". This varies from place to place, and may be in the form of days, half days, or hours.

The typical format of the meeting is that development items are taken from the backlog and put into the forthcoming sprint. The backlog should be already prepared and ready to take items from. The team then decides, together, how long they think it will take to complete the necessary tasks on this requirement. This is repeated until all the available hours have been allocated.
