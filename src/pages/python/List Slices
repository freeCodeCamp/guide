## List Slicing

A Slice of a list is its sub-list.Slices are considered as constraint/boundaries, and the result will contain all the elements between these boundaries.
For a list slice, we use [x:y] operator.It is inclusive for xth element but exclusive for yth element.So the resultant list will contain y-x elements in it. 

#### Syntax

List = L[start: stop: step]

Where start, stop & step- all three are optional. If you omit first index, slice starts from
“0” and omitting of stop will take it to end. Default value of step is 1.

#### Example 

```py

L2=[“Gwalior”, “Bhopal”, “Indore”]
print L2[0:2]
# prints [“Gwalior”, “Bhopal”] 	

```

####Example2

```py
List = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

print List [::2]                   # produce a list with every alternate element

# prints [1, 3, 5]

print List [4:]                  # will produce a list containing all the elements from 5th position till end           

# prints [5, 6]

print List [:3]                      #produce a list containing all the elements from 1st to 3rd index 

# prints [1, 2, 3]

print List [:]                             #produce a list contains all the elements  

# prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

print List [-1]                           # “-1”  refers to last elements of list

# prints 6

```
