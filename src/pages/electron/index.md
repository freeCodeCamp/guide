## Electron - Build cross platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

Electron lets you build cross-platform desktop apps using web technology. You
can build desktop apps for Windows, Mac, and most common flavors of Linux.

Electron is built on Chromium (the open-sourced version of Google Chrome). You
use web technologies like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to build Electron apps. That
means you can use most any web technology you want to build your native desktop
app! For example, you could use [React](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/building-an-electron-application-with-create-react-app-97945861647c) or [Angular](https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-desktop-applications-with-angularjs-and-github-electron) to build your first desktop app.

Additionally, Electron comes with support for auto-updating, crash reporting,
and native menus.

Core features can be explored using the [Electron API demos](https://github.com/electron/electron-api-demos)

Some apps built using Electron include:
* Atom (GitHub's open-source text-editor)
* Visual Studio Code (Microsoft's open-source text-editor)
* Slack (A messaging app for teams)
