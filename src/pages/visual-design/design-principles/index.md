Design Principles
---
In the world of visual design, a basic set of principles are taught to give you a starting point. These principles are used in graphic design education around the world. Learning more about these overall principles will help you create better looking websites. 

Depending on the source you reference, there are slight differences in wording and definition. To give you a good start, use this list of the design principles:

* Balance
* Emphasis 
* Movement
* Pattern
* Repetition
* Proportion 
* Rhythm
* Variety
* Unity
* Space
* Color

You can use these principles equally well to organize large amounts of information (like in the design of a magazine or a website) or in small areas (like a favicon). 

One way to start thinking about the design principles is to start observing them in daily life. What principles do you see being used on your favorite website? What principle sticks out to you the most on the board game you played last night? What principle makes a great logo memorable? You can see the principles of design all around you once you start looking.
