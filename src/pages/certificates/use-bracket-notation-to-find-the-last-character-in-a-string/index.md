title: Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String
---
In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if `var firstName = "Charles"`, you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using `firstName[firstName.length - 1]`.

    var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length -1];
