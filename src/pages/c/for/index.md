# For Loop

The `for` loop executes a block of code until a specified condition is false. Use `while` loops when the number of iterations are variable, otherwise use `for` loops. A common use of `for` loops are array iterations.

## Example
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {

    int i;
    int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    	printf("Item on index %d is %d\n", i, array[i]);
    }
}
```

## Output:
```
> Item on index 0 is 1
> Item on index 1 is 2
> Item on index 2 is 3
> Item on index 3 is 4
```
