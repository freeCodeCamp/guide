## Declare String Variables

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
In JavaScript, variables are <strong>dynamic</strong>. That means they can hold numbers, strings, or any other data type at a given time. To declare a string, simply <strong>initialize</strong> (create) a variable:

    var a;
    
Then, using single or double quotation marks, declare the string:

    a = "Hello Camper!";
