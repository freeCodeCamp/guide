## Area of a Triangle

The area of a triangle is defined as the space enclosed by the perimeter of the triangle.

#### Terminology

Height (h) - The vertical length of the parallelogram from top to bottom. Measured at right angle with the base.

Base (b) - The horizontal width of the parallelogram from left to right.

#### Formula

Area of a triangle = 1/2 * b * h

#### Example

1. A triangle has a base of 6in and is 3in high, what is the area?

Area of a triangle = 1/2 * b * h
  b = 6in
  h = 3in
  
Area of a triangle = 1/2 * 6in * 3in
Area of a triangle = 9in
