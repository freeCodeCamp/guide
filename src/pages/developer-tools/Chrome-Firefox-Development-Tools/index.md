## Chrome Firefox Development Tools

Development tools are tools for web designers to create, debug, and profile their websites. A developer can use them to view the source code of a page, make minor temporary client-side adjustments to a page, or monitor a page's performance to discover any issues.

Developer tools are typically built into a browser.
