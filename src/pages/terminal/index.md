### File exploration


`Ranger`

Ranger is a VIM like filemanager, very useful to navigate in your filesystem through the terminal, [Link to Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)

`Exa`

Tired of non color `ls` command, well your wish became true with `exa`, it's a command to give you a colored output of `ls` command.
It takes the same flags so just setup an alias and you'll be good to go. [Link to Exa](https://the.exa.website/)

`z`

Well, `z` is a very powerfull tool, whenever you navigate through your folders, it gives you the ability to quickly jump to a folder in particulary.
Let's say that you work in a folder call *javascript-project*, after navigate in once, you'll be able to run :
```
z javascript
```
To directly jump right in the folder, event if it's 3,4,6...10 and more level deep in the folder structure. [Link to z](https://github.com/rupa/z)

#### Funny commands

`Ponysay`

After a basic cowsay with your teammate, what could you do ?
Print unicorn in ASCII right in your terminal (If it was not your first thought, shame on you).
`Ponysay` is a funny collection of unicorn who can say anything, it's funny, especially when they give wisdom puns.
Add : 
```
fortune | ponysay
```
At the startup of your terminal all you'll be the wisest cool kid at the office. [Link to Ponysay](https://github.com/erkin/ponysay)
