<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->

Actual time estimation is a time-based method of estimating development work.  

Its intent is to best approximate the amount of time required to complete a given development task. 

Generally, these estimates are calculated using ideal engineering hours. 

Examples: 
##### This task will be complete in 10 days. 

Or… 
##### This task will be complete by January 10th. 

Or… 
##### This task will require 25 development hours for completion.
