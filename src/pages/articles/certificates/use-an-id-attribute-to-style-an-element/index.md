title: Use An Id Attribute To Style An Element
---
One cool thing about `id` attributes is that, like classes, you can style them using CSS.

Here's an example of how you can take your element with the `id` attribute of cat-photo-element and give it the background color of green.

In your style element: `#cat-photo-element { background-color: green; }`

Note that inside your style element, you always reference classes by putting a `.` in front of their names. You always reference ids by putting a `#` in front of their names.
