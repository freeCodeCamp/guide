## Introduction to HTML5 Elements

To wrap an HTML element around other HTML element(s)  means to put the <em>inner</em> element(s) after the opening tag of the wrapper and before its closing tag.<br/>

The example below represent a `h1` element and a `h4` element wrapped into a `header` element:
```
<header>
  <h1> Big title </h1>
  <h4> Tiny subtitle </h4>
</header>
```

As you can see the `header` contains the other elements that ends up on the same level ( the `h1` ends before the `h4` starts and both are nested into the `header`).
