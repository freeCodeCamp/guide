## Bootstrap Grid System

Bootstrap uses a twelve column grid system, useful for designing a layout that will work well across different size screens from mobile and tablet to desktop.

You build your grid with containers, rows, and columns.

#### How it works

###### Container
The container is the outer most element that will *contain* your grid, use `container` for a fixed width container in the middle of the screen (extra margin on larger screens) or `container-fluid` for full width.

```
<div class="container"></div>
```

###### Row
Use `row` to group your columns, this will keep everything lined up properly and help you structure your grid.
```
<div class="row"></div>
```

###### Columns
Column classes indicate the number of columns youâ€™d like to use out of the possible 12 per row. For example `col-sm-6` would mean your column would use up half the width of the `row` on a small screen, and `col-lg-4` would use up a third on a large screen.

Here is how you would define a class prefix to use up one column width on the various screen sizes:

- **Extra Small** `col-1`
- **Small** `col-sm-1`
- **Medium** `col-md-1`
- **Large** `col-lg-1`
- **Extra Large** `col-xl-1`

```
<div class="col-sm-1"></div>
```


#### Example

A full width grid that has four columns, that each take up a full row on xs screens, half a row on sm and md screens, and a quarter of the width of the row on screens that are large and above.

```
<div class="container-fluid">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-lg-4">First Column</div>
    <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-lg-4">Second Column</div>
    <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-lg-4">Third Column</div>
    <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-lg-4">Forth Column</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

*Note that `col-md` and `col-xl` are not defined, where a size is not defined, it will default down to the next smaller size that has been specified.*

*This guide is based on Bootstrap v4 (it will work with v3 accept extra small screens are defined as `xs` and there is no `xl` size)*
