Empathy mapping is a tool used to anticipate the thoughts, emotions, needs, and reactions of an interface user.  They can be used along with user personas in User Experience Research at the beginning of the design process, in order to determine what problems the user is facing, and how the interface design can help resolve them.

Empathy maps work best when researchers make them after conducting user interviews.  Empathy mapping sessions benefit from a diverse range of team members: stakeholders, customer support leads, vendors, product developers, salespeople, and copywriters.
