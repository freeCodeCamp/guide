### 1. Area of parallelogram in terms of side (b) and height (b):
   
   Area = b \* h

### 2. Area of parallelogram in terms of sides and sine of an angle between the sides: 

  Area = a\*b\* sinα
  
  where α is the corresponding angle between the sides
  
### 3. Area of parallelogram in terms of diagonals and sine of an angle between diagonals:

  Area = 1/2 \* d<sub>1</sub>\*d<sub>2</sub>\*sinγ

  where γ is the corresponding angle between the diagonals
