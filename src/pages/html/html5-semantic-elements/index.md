## HTML5 Semantic Elements

### A Quick History
HTML was originally created as a markup language to describe documents on the early internet. As the internet grew and was adopted by more people, it's needs changed. Where the internet was originally inteded for sharing scientific documents, now people wanted to share other things as well. Very quickly, people started wanting to make the web look nicer. Because the web was not initially built to be designed, people had to hack to get things laid out in different ways. Rather than using the ```<table></table>``` to describe information using a table, people would use them to position other elements on a page. 

### HTML5 
HTML5 has put a focus back on elements that are semantically accurate. Semantic elements are elements that clearly describe it's meaning in a human and machine readable way. This is especially important for accessibility. 

New semantic HTML5 elements include ```<header>```, ```<nav>```, ```<section>```, ```<article>```, ```<aside>```, and ```<footer>```, elements among others. These ones act more or less like ```<div>``` elements in that they group other elements together into page sections. However where a ```<div>```  tag could contain any type of information, it is easy to identify what sort of information would go in a semantic ```<header>``` region.
