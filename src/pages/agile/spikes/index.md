## Spikes

Spikes are used by individuals and teams to gain insight into an area where more information is needed. Spikes are typically time-boxed to a relatively short period with results often reported back to the rest of the team or other interested stakeholders.

Examples of spikes might be trying out a new user interface toolkit, reading up on some impending technology, or trying out a new automated test framework.
