title: Setting Up Python Web Framework Django and Flask
---
In this article, we shall be discussing how to install <a href='https://www.djangoproject.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Django</a> and <a href='http://flask.pocoo.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Flask</a> - two popular web frameworks written in Python.

Perhaps you are already familiar with the widespread usage and community support for Python; in web-development. You might as well be aware as to what a web framework is; and the options available for Python.

In case these assumptions are untrue, you might want to take a look at this <a>wiki article</a>. If you are all caught up, let's go ahread with setting up Python web frameworks in your local development machine.

But it would be unfair if we completely ignore the <a href='http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/which-python/#the-state-of-python-2-vs-3' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Python 2 vs Python 3</a> debate.

## Python Web Frameworks || Django

Django is a Python web framework. It is free and open source and has been around since 2005. It is very mature and comes with excellent documentation and awesome features included by default. Some excellent tools it provides are:

1. Excellent lightweight server for development and testing.
2. Good templating language.
3. Security features like CSRF included right out of the box.
4. There are a myriad of other useful things included in Django but you shall probably discover them as you go along.

## Wrapping Up

We have successfully installed the web-framework of our need. However, it's not yet complete. Most web applications are content and data driven - so we need a data storage. Or, a Database, if you will.

In next article, we would be discussing how to install PostgreSQL and use it with our Python web application.

A point to ponder - we have been using `pip` heavily, but we have barely said anything about it. Well, for now, it's just a package manager like `npm`. It has some differences with `npm`; but, you don't need to worry about that now. If you are interested, do check out the <a href='http://pip-python3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>official `pip` documentation</a>.
