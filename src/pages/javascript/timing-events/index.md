## Timing Events

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->

There are two main methods for timing when code is executed, window.setTimeout() and window.setInterval().

* window.setTimeout() is used to call a function or evaluates an expression after a set amount of milliseconds.
* window.setInterval() is used to repeatedly call a function or evaluate an expression at every given time interval.
