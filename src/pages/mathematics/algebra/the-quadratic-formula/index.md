## The Quadratic Formula

This mathematic formula came to us in its present-day form from French philosopher and mathemtician Ren√© Descartes in 1637. It is used in geometry to find the location a parabola (a symmetric curve, the ends of which approach parallel, but never reach it), which is given by the equation ![y equals a times x squared plus b times x plus c](https://github.com/jdhines/freecodecamp-article-images/blob/master/equation_parabola.png).

The quadratic formula itself, which solves for x, is given as:

To see how you get the quadratic formula, solving for x, from the parabola formula, [view the derivation on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula#Derivation_of_the_formula)
