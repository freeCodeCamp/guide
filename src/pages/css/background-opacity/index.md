Background Opacity helps make whatever your background is (ie. a photo, a block of text, etc) be transparent.
When placing opacity over an item, you choose the degree of transparency by selecting a value between 0.0 and 1.0:

*Light Opacity*
opacity: 0.2;

*Medium Opacity*
opacity: 0.5;

*Heavy Opacity*
opacity: 0.9;
