## Doctype Declaration
The doctype declaration or DTD tells the web browser which syntax the page is written in so it can render the page correctly. The DTD is always the first line in the source code and since HTML5, the DTD is written as `<!DOCTYPE html>` as is case-insensitive.

### Doctypes of old
Before HTML 5, DTDs were required to be much more verbose. Here's an example DTD from the HTML 4.01 days.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
```
