## Typescript

TypeScript is a strictly-typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
If you have used languages that support strict-typing, like Java, Typescript is like a "Java" version of Javascript. It is strictly-typed and promotes Object Oriented Programming, adding features like interfaces, classes, and enums. Also, it adds static typing functionality to JavaScript.

Valid JavaScript is valid Typescript, so it's really easy to get started. If you want to easily try out TypeScript without installing it, visit the <a href='http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>TypeScript Playground</a>. To learn more about installation, see the [Installation Appendix](./src/articles/typescript/appendix-installation/index.md).
