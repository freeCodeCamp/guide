I have designed and deployed various landing pages and one of them is <a href='https://spark.shellstack.com'>Spark</a>. You need to focus on three important points about landing pages:

* Must load fast (Within few second).
* Message to be displayed in above the fold of web page.
* One simple action on homepage like big text box to capture email, big button to get started here etc.

### Must load fast (Within few second)
The reason why it's landing page becuase this would be first page people would see. It must load fast in all the devices. Make sure you have proxy and cache enable plus the library size must be minified and serve with cache. 

If you have SSL enabled, make sure it's optimization rating is A+.

### Message to be displayed in above the fold of web page
If your landing page is about newsletters, make sure you have giant text box to collect emails with a clear and bold message. Similarly, your landing page above the fold page i.e the one visible to users without a scroll should display and show correct message and have proper Call to action page.

### Call to action
Make sure you have proper call to action on above the fold page. For example, text box to collect emails, button to redirect on home page, introduction video etc.
