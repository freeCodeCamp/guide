#### The <video> element
  
The <video> element allows you to embed a video very easily. A really simple example looks like this:
 
<video src="rabbit320.webm" controls>
<p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.webm">link to the video</a> instead.</p> 
</video>

The features of note are:

**src**
In the same way as for the <img> element, the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way.

**controls**
Users must be able to control video and audio playback (it's especially critical for people who have epilepsy.) You must either use the controls attribute to include the browser's own control interface, or build your interface using the appropriate JavaScript API. At minimum, the interface must include a way to start and stop the media, and to adjust the volume.

The embedded video will look something like this:
