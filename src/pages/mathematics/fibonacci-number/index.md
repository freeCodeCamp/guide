## Fibonacci Number

A 'Fibonacci' number is one from a integer sequence called the 'Fibonacci sequence'. The sequence is characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones, i.e.

F<sub>n = F <sub>n-1</sub> + F <sub>n-2</sub>
  
Sequence:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55, ...
