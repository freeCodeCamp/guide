## Sprint Review

The Sprint Review is one of the key Scrum ceremonies (along with Sprint Planning, the Daily Stand Up, the Retrospective, and Grooming).

At the end of the Sprint, your Scrum team hosts an "Invite the World" session to showcase what has just been Completed and Accepted. Invited are the Scrum Team, Stakeholders, Managers, Users; anyone with an interest in the project.

Holding these sessions every Sprint is important. It may be a mindset shift; showing unfinished work to your managers and stakeholders. But in the concept of "Fail Fast", there is incredible value in getting feedback on your incremental work. Your team can course-correct if necessary,  minimizing work lost. 

Since the Product Owner (PO) is often presenting at the Sprint Review, the Scrum Master will usually capture the feedback, perhaps facilitate the discussions, and then work with the PO to get new User Stories added to the Backlog and prioritized.

The agenda may also include a review of the Backlog (including value and priority), what is scheduled for the next Iteration or two, and what can be removed from the Backlog.

**IMPORTANT** The Sprint Review is completely different than the Retrospective. The Retrospective is stricly for the Scrum team (Scrum Master, PO and Delivery Team). The other parties that are invited to the Review are excused from, and will likely interfere with, the Retrospective. (Yes, including Managers.)
