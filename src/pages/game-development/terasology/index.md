An open-source voxel sandbox game!

>The Terasology project was born from a Minecraft-inspired tech demo and is becoming a stable platform for various types of gameplay settings in a voxel world. The creators and maintainers are a diverse mix of software developers, designers, game testers, graphic artists, and musicians. We encourage others to join!

Terasology is an open-source platform for gameplay of any kind in a voxel world. If you read that sentence attentively you can see I did not use the word 'Game'. The reason behind that is the fact that Terasology itself is not a finished game! It's merely a platform for you to modify yourself with your own code or pre-made modules. Do not worry though, there are loads of modules constantly developed by the multidisciplinary team. 

### The open-source spirit

Another really cool aspect of this game is fact that MovingBlocks (the organisation behind Terasology) participates in large events such as GCI (Google Code-In), GSOC (Google Summer of Code) and more! This makes the environment especially lively and it really empowers the community spirit. This is not some random product made by a greedy multinational, this is the work of a team. A team with a passion.

### How can I contribute?

You too can contribute! Check out the repository here on GitHub and start hacking into the code! Make sure you format everything properly, use clear code and follow all of the repository-specific conventions! https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki
