## Upper and Lower Case
Uppercase (UC) is alternatively referred to as caps and capital. It is a typeface of larger characters. Lowercase (LC) is a typeface of small characters. As long as the shift key is not being pressed and the Caps lock is not active, everything typed is in lowercase. The Uppercase and Lowercase is often synonymous with Majuscule and Minuscule.

## Uppercase:
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
## Lowercase:
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

Capitalization is important for the following reasons:
- Passwords: passwords are case sensitive, so capitalization add an extra level of security.
- Measurements: When dealing with computer measurement, and other measurements, capitalization is important for identifying the exact type of measurement. For example, "Mb" (short for Megabit) and "MB" (short for Megabyte) are two different types of measurements with different values.
- Commands 
- File names, directories and paths.
