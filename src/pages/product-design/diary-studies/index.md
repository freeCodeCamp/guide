## Diary Studies

Diary Studies are used as a long-term method to collect information from user participants. Diaries can record thoughts, feelings, or behaviours in a participant's life. This information can be used by designers as a method of exploratory research and idea generation.

User participants are given a blank journal, which should be kept with them as often as possible. Alternatively, an online journal can be used. Participants should be informed of the topic of interest, so diary entries are specific to the given topic. Participants can be instructed write entries when they are in given situations, engage in given behaviours, or interact with given products. They can also be instructed to write entries at certain times in the day, the week, or the month.

Diary entries can consist of anything – text, sketches, drawings, symbols, pictures, and even stickers. Each entry should be guided by a prompt or idea.

Once collected, researchers can analyze diary entries and detect underlying patterns among participants. Information collected can be used to inspire designers, as well as provide insight into potential limitations of any potential designs.
