## RAM

RAM stands for random-access memory, alternatively referred to as **main memory**, **primary memory**, or **system memory**. It is a piece of computer hardware where the data that your computer is currently working on is stored.<br/>
Unlike hard drives, RAM is a volatile memory and requires power to keep the data accessible. If the computer is turned off, all data contained in RAM is lost. New users often confuse RAM with disk drive space. See <a href='https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/memory.htm' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>memory</a> definition for a comparison between memory and storage.<br/>

#### Types of RAM:
There are two main types of RAM: static (SRAM) and dynamic (DRAM). Static RAM is constructed using flip-flops, is very fast, but is difficult to make in large sizes. Dyanmic RAM is constructed using capacitors, is fairly fast, but needs 'refreshed' periodically to keep charge on the capacitors. SRAM is often used closer to the CPU due to it's speed and space constraints whereas DRAM is used as main memory.

Some examples of packaging RAM are: DIMM, RIMM, SIMM, SO-DIMM, and SOO-RIMM. Below is an example image of a 512 MB DIMM computer memory module, a typical piece of RAM found in desktop computers. This memory module would be installed into one of the memory slots on a motherboard.

#### RAM speeds:
The speed rating of your RAM module is an expression of its data transfer rate, and it's almost always expressed in megahertz (Mhz). The faster the number, the faster your computer can store and retrieve the data stored in local memory. The formula for the exact speed rating changes slightly based on the version of DDR memory your computer is using. Itâ€™s no longer simply an expression of clock speed, like a processor, but a combination of hardware factors. But in general, faster is better. Like the GPU and CPU, RAM can also be overclocked. To achieve the faster speed, a user has to enable an XMP (Intel) or AMP (AMD) profile in the BIOS.
The standard which dictates the rough speed for RAM in most computers has been DDR3, which is still widely adopted and supports a limit fo 2133Mhz. A new standard, DDR4, has been released in recent years and promises a wider range of clock speeds and reduced power consumption and latencies.
