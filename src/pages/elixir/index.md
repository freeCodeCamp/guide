## Elixir

Elixir is a dynamic, functional programming language built to run on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). Elixir is known for being a concurrent and general purpose language that is often leveraged with the powerful Phoenix framework. This language was created by Jos√© Valim, and has been influenced by languages like Ruby, Erlang, and Closure.
