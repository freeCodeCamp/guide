## Alignment
Alignment is a fundamental typographic practice wherein we set the flow of text relative to an entire page, column, table cell, or tab in the document. Alignment is sometimes referred to as text alignment, text justification, or type justification.

There are mainly four types of text alignment **Flush Left**, **Centered**, **Flush Right** and **Justified**.

> NOTE: The edge of a page or column is known as a margin, and the gap between columns is known as a gutter.

#### Flush Left
In the *flush left* alignment the text is aligned along the left margin or gutter. The Article you are reading now is an example of a left aligned text block.

#### Centered
In a *centered* alignment the text is aligned along the center of the page or column. The gap beteween the left and right margin from the text will be the same in this type of alignment.

#### Flush Right
In the *flush right* alignment the text is aligned along the right margin or gutter.

#### Justified
In a *justified* text, the spacing between words and letters are modified such that the text block falls flush with both margins. Justification is a common practice in print media. During justification it is customary to treat the last line separately by aligning it to either left or right depending on the language.

Modern typesetting programs sometimes offer four additional justification optons namely *left justify*, *right justify*, *center justify* and *full justify*. These variants specify whether the full lines of a paragraph are aligned to the left, right, centered, or are fully justified.
