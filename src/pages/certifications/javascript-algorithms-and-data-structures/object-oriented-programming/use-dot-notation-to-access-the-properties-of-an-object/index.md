## Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object

### Method:

The following code will simply print `property1` from the `obj` object.

```javascript

let obj = {
  property1 = 1,
  property2 = 2
};

console.log(obj.property1);

```

Following this logic, use the `console.log` operation to print both `property1`and `property2`to the screen.

### Solution:

```javascript

let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};
// Add your code below this line
console.log(dog.name);
console.log(dog.numLegs);


```
