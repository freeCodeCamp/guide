## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) 

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software that consolidates the basic tools developers need to write and test software in one application.

IDEs offer a central graphic user interface (GUI) that incorporates the following: a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, a debugger, and build automation tools.

Examples of IDEs are:
 - [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/)
 - [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)
 - [ItelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
 - [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/)
 - [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
 - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
