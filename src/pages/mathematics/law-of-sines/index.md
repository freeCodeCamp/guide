## Law of Sines

The Law of Sines simply states that:

Sin(A)   Sin(B)
------ = ------
  a         b

Where "A" and "B" are angle measures, and "a" and "b" are their corresponding side lengths
This law is used with triangles, when two angles and one side length are known, here is an example:
     b
____________
\        75/
 \        /
6 \      /
   \    /
    \30/
     \/

In this problem, everything is defined except for "b," therefore, we can use the law of sines to find it. For this problem, I will 
refer to the corresponding angle and side as "A" and "a":

Sin(A)   Sin(B)      Sin(75)   Sin(30)
------ = ------ ===> ------- = ------- 
  a         b           6         b

For evaluating the Sines, I used a calculator. I can cross multiply the two sides of the equation, which evaluates as:

    6 * Sin(30)
b = -----------
      sin(75)

Which comes out to

b = 3.106
