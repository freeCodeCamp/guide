## Human Computer Interaction

Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a growing academic field that studies the ways in which humans use computers and other electronic devices.  Computers, as tools, have an almost limitless range of uses.  When humans use computers, it is a through a dialogue.  In some ways, this is more similar to humans interacting with other humans, than to humans interacting with tools.

Humans interact with computers mostly through graphical user interfaces (GUI), and sometimes through voice user interfaces (VUI).  In the field of User Experience/User Interaction (UX/UI), human-computer interaction is studied to ensure optimal user satisfaction and engagement with a piece of software.
