title: Access Array Data with Indexes
---
We can access the data inside an array using indexes.

Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, but instead of specifying a character, they specify an entry in the array.

For example:

```javascript
var array = [1, 2, 3];
array[0]; // equals 1
var data = array[1]; // sets the data variable to 2
```

Note: The index for arrays start from 0 as opposed to 1. Hence, array[0] equals 1. You can also think of it as position. In the above example 1 resides in position 0, 2 in position 1 and 3 in position 2.
