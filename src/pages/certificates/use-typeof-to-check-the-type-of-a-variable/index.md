title: Use Typeof to Check the Type of a Variable
---
You can use `typeof` to check the `data structure`, or type, of a variable.

Note that in JavaScript, arrays are technically a type of object.

    console.log(typeof(""));

    console.log(typeof(0));

    console.log(typeof([]));

    console.log(typeof({}));
