## Backlog Emergence and Grooming

Scrum is a practical framework to build products, provided you plan in advance what to build. But even after a successful product discovery phase, you may struggle to assemble the proper item in the proper way if your product backlog is weighing you down. 

Product backlog grooming is an on going process that needs to be in sync with the product discovery process. Generally, a scrum team will collaboratively refine product backlog items for the next two to three sprints.

A product owner (individual responsible for clarifying a sprint's goal) defines the scope of the upcoming sprints by identifying and triaging the most valuable user stories in the product backlog. A product owner is more than a glorified project manager of the product backlog, and performs more roles than simply user stories on behalf of stakeholders.

Backlog emergence and grooming are essential tasks for every scrum team. Although the product owner is in charge of keeping the product backlog at peak value delivery, they need the assistance of the entire scrum team to do so.
