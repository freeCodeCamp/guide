## ScrumMasters

The ScrumMaster is one of the three key roles on the Scrum team, along with the Product Owner (PO) and the Delivery Team. 
- You are the servant leader; neither above nor below the rest of the team in importance or authority.
- Lead by example 
- Teach the team the principles of Scrum (and other Agile methodologies)
- Are transparent and provide transparency to operations and metrics
- Coach the team to improve
- Remove impediments to the team's efficiency
- Protect the team from interference
- Lead and facilitate the Scrum ceremonies, such as the Retrospective or Sprint Planning
- The voice of reality for a team; speaking up when they are too ambitious or are over-committing.

You are not the manager or leader of the team. During the Daily Standup, for example, directing the update to you rather than to the entire team is considered a "smell". (A sign that something is wrong.) Another smell is the ScrumMaster directing or assigning work, rather than the team guiding themselves.

Your role is a matter of Influence, rather than Ownership.
