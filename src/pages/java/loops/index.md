# Loops

Whenever you need to execute a block of code multiple times, a loop will often
come in handy.

Java has 4 types of loops:
* [While Loop](loops/while-loop)
* [Do...While Loop](loops/do-while-loop)
* [For Loop](loops/for-loop)
* [For Each Loop](loops/for-each-loop)

Loops behaviour can be customized using:
* [Control Statements](loops/control-statements)
    * [Break Control Statement](loops/break-control-statement)
    * [Continue Control Statement](loops/continue-control-statement)

A special case of loops:
* [Infinite Loops](loops/infinite-loops)
