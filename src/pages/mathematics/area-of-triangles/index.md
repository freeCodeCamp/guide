## Area of Triangles

Given a triangle we can find out its area with different approaches.

## Given the length of the base and the height (or altitude)
base: `a`
height: `h`

`Area = (a*h)/2`

## Given a length of two sides and an angle between them:
sides: `a, b`
angle: `\alpha`

`Area = a * b * sin(\alpha)`
