title: Bash cd
---

## Bash command: cd

**Change Directory** to the path specified, for example `cd projects`.

There are a few really helpful arguments to aid this:

- `.` refers to the current directory, such as `./projects`
- `..` can be used to move up one folder, use `cd ..`, and can be combined to move up multiple levels `../../my_folder`
- `/` is the root of your system to reach core folders, such as `system`, `users`, etc.
- `~` is the home directory, usually the path `/users/username`. Move back to folders referenced relative to this path by including it at the start of your path, for example `~/projects`.
