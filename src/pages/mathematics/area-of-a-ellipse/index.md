## Area of a Ellipse

#### Terminology

Ellipse (E): An ellipse is the set of all points on a plane whose distance	from two fixed points F and G add up to a constant.

Major radius (a): the distance from the center of the ellipse to the farthest edge of the ellipse.

Minor radius (b): the distance from the center to the closest point on the edge

#### Formula
The area of the ellipse is a x b x π.

#### Example:
Given: major radius=5 cm and minor radius of 3 cm. Find the area of the ellipse:

Area = 3 x 5 x π, or about 47 cm^2.
