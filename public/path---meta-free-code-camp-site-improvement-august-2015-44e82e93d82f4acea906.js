If you have time to go back and try our new challenges, they should be a quick review for you. Otherwise, keep moving forward.</p>\n<h3>Why are you deploying all these improvements at once?</h3>\n<p>We’ve been working on some of the features for months on our Staging branch. Most of them were held up by a single task: our transition to <a href='http://loopback.io/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Loopback</a>. <a href=\"/users/berkeleytrue\">@BerkeleyTrue</a> started working on this back in March.</p>\n<h3>Was deploying everything at once necessary?</h3>\n<p>Probably not. Going forward, we will deploy new code several times a day (as we did prior to the Loopback feature). We plan to start using a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>continuous integration</a> and other agile best practices as we reduce our <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>technical debt</a>.</p>",fields:{slug:"/meta/free-code-camp-site-improvement-august-2015/"},frontmatter:{title:"Free Code Camp Site Improvement August 2015"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/meta/free-code-camp-site-improvement-august-2015/"}}}});
