## Chrome Firefox Development Tools

Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers come with a powerful set of development tools that are commonly used in Web Development. The development tools contain a source code inspector, an application console, a network monitor, a debugger, as well as tools to monitor memory usage and performance of a given webpage.

The development tools are accessed by right clicking anywhere on a webpage, and choosing the 'Inspect' (Chrome) or 'Inspect Element' (Firefox) option.
