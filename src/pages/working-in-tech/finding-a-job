This process is likely to vary based on whether or not you are a student. Students should consult the finding an internship file instead.
Finding a tech job will likely require many of the same steps as finding a job in a different field.
First, review your resume and ensure that it is up to date with all your most recent projects (including a github profile with any 
relevant projects you've completed).
Next, search on different job sites such as linkedin to find current openings and apply. 
If you have family or friends who work in the tech industry, as them to pass your resume along to the appropriate hiring department.
If you attended a major university, you can try looking for other alumni from the university and reaching out to them (often via linkedin)
to see if they would be willing to discuss their job with you, and/or pass your resume along to the hiring department.

Happy job hunting!
