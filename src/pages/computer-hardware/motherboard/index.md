## Motherboard

The motherboard is the connecting layer that allows a computer's components to interact with each other. The motherboard typically has connections for random access memory (RAM), a hard drive, a graphics processing unit (GPU), and a central processing unit (CPU). In desktops, the motherboard is a physical board to which all of these components are connected. However, in laptops, the motherboard typically has some of these components integrated due to the space constraints of laptops.

A motherboard provides power and connectivity to the computer's components, and acts as the switchboard for all inter-component communications. If the CPU needs to process information that is stored in RAM, for example, the motherboard provides a connection between the CPU and RAM, called the memory bus, to allow for data access. A motherboard includes buses for expansion cards (including the GPU), RAM, and hard drives.
