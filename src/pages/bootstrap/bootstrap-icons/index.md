## Bootstrap Icons

Bootstrap doesn't have default icons. The previous versions of the framework included icons library called Glyphicons but it was dropped in the Boostrap 4.

There are several options to use icons with Bootstrap. The preferred icon sets are: [Iconic](https://useiconic.com/open/), [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/) and [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com/). The recommended file format is Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).
