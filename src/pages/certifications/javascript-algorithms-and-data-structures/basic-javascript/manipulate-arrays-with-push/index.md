## Manipulate Arrays With push()

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
The `push()` method allows you to append (add to the end) an element to an array. Like so...

```javascript
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
arr.push(5); // Now, the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
