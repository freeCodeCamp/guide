## Minimum Viable Product

A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and to start collecting feedback from real-life users for future product development. Some say an MVP needs to be complete enough to sell. 

> "It's not an MVP until you sell it. Viable means you can sell it."

The concept became popular thanks to a book by Eric Ries, called [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/).
