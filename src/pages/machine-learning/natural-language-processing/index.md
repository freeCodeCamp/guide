## Natural Language Processing(NLP)

As the Wikipedia says, "Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data."
In simpler terms, it is a process in which natural language generated by humans are made sense of by computers.

### Challenges in NLP
#### 1.Easy or mostly solved
			  *Spam detection
			  *Part of Speech Tagging
			  *Named Entity Recognition
#### 2.Intermediate or making good progress

			  *Word sense disambiguation
			  *Parsing
			  *Machine Translation
			  *Information Translation
#### 3.Hard or still need lot of work
			  *Text Summarization
