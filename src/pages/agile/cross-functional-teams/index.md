## Cross Functional Teams

A Cross Functional Team includes people from various domains, eg. engineering, design, testing, etc. Each of which will be skilled in their specialist area but capable of having an input in other domains. This helps to form a strong team that is resilient to unforeseen circumstances where a team member may need to work on something that isn't their specialist skill.
