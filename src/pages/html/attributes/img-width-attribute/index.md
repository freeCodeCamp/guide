## Img Width Attribute

The `width` attribute refers to the width of the image you want to display, and is referenced inside the `<img>` tag. You can reference the `height` attribute in the same way. The width and height attributes are measured in pixels.

For example:

```html
<html>
  <head>

  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9892522?v=4&s=400" width="500" height="500"
  </body>
</html>
```
