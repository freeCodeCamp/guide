## High Availability

High Availability is a term that implies that your systems are tolerant to faults and errors. For example, if you have a service running that relies on one server and that server experiences a hardware failure that causes the server to go offline your system will not be able to function, therefore experiencing an 'outage'.

Some single points of failures can include
* Internet connection
* Hardware
* Software
* Networking Equipment.
