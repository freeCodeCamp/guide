## Sprint

As described in the <a href='https://www.scrumguides.org'>Scrum Guide</a>, a Sprint is a time-box of one month or less during which a 
“Done”, useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the
previous Sprint.

Sprints contain and consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.

Sprints are limited to one calendar month. A Sprint can be cancelled before the Sprint time-box is over. Only the Product Owner has the
authority to cancel the Sprint, although he or she may do so under influence from the stakeholders, the Development Team, or the Scrum 
Master.

A Sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. This might occur if the company changes direction or if market or 
technology conditions change.

When a Sprint is cancelled, any completed and “Done” Product Backlog items are reviewed. If part of the work is potentially releasable, 
the Product Owner typically accepts it. All incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog. The 
work done on them depreciates quickly and must be frequently re-estimated. Sprint cancellations consume resources, since everyone has to 
regroup in another Sprint Planning to start another Sprint. Sprint cancellations are often traumatic to the Scrum Team, and are very 
uncommon.
