## Open Source

Open source software is any type of software that is available to the public to see or to be downloaded for free. Anyone is capable of creating a open source project.
Open source projects are legally made open through a creative license. They are changed, maintained or abandoned by their creators at any time. Many open source projects have contributors that volunteer to add and edit code, and a growing number of open source projects are taking a major place among the most popular softwares available today.

In short, the Open source softwares are of **lower cost**, **higher security** and **better quality** when compared to propreitary softwares.

One of the biggest Open Source project is Linux.
