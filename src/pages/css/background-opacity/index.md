`opacity` is a css property that specifies the opacity or transparency factor of an element.
```
img {
    opacity: 0.5;
}
```
The above code snippet applies 50% opacity to an img element. The value of opacity property can range between 0 to 1. Higher the value of `opactiy`, lower is the transparency of the element.
