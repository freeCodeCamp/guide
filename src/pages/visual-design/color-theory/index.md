## Color Theory

Color Theory is the practical application of mixing and using colors together to achieve a specific visual effect. This is a broad and quite complicated term. It can be broken down further into segments describing where to find colors, how to use color, and how color can impact usability, and more.

### Finding/locating Colors

A color wheel is the main tool used by designers to find color. Color wheels can include the entire color spectrum or they can be organized by a defined category of colors. The three main category of colors, which you might already be familiar with, are Primary Colors, Secondary Colors, and Tertiary Colors.

**Primary Colors:**
Red, yellow and blue
In traditional color theory primary colors are the 3 pigment colors that cannot be mixed or formed by any combination of other colors. All other colors are derived from these 3 hues. 

**Secondary Colors:**
Green, orange and purple
These are the colors formed by mixing the primary colors.

**Tertiary Colors:** 
Yellow-orange, red-orange, red-purple, blue-purple, blue-green & yellow-green
These are the colors formed by mixing a primary and a secondary color. 

### Using Colors in design (Color Harmony)
Color harmony is the arrangement of colors in order to give the user the best visual experience possible. When colors are in harmony, the design becomes enjoyable; if not, the design becomes chaotic and not enjoyable.

Three main types of color harmony:
1. Monochromatic: based on one color and shades of it

2. Analogous: based on colors next to each other

3. Complementary: high contrast color scheme that uses opposite colors

Their derivatives:
- Split-complementary: isosceles triangle
- Triadic: equilateral triangle
- Double complementary/tetradic: four base colors that are complementary pairs (use carefully unless you are a highly experienced designer)

### Impact on Usability

In any form of visual design, colors carry with them connotations and implications that need to be understood or else you could cause confusion. The color red in a non-digital space, such as a fast-food restaurant, carries the implication of energy or excitement. 

However, on the web the color red also carries with it the implication that the user has committed an error. This example of how color means certain things in certain settings should be a critical reminder to understand how the person viewing your page will interpret the color selection you’ve made.

The overall experience a person has when viewing your page is also determined by the color selection you’ve made. For example, using light-gray or yellow color text on a white background makes it very tough for most people to read. This is due to a lack of contrast between the colors. Black text on a white background or white text on a blue background conversely has high contrast and will be easier to read.

Individuals who are affected by color-blindness might not be able to differentiate between similar colors as easily as you either. What you perceive as a wonderful palette of greens and blues might appear gray, beige, and dull to someone else. Importantly, if you choose a text color that views well for you, it might have much lower contrast than you realize to someone else, making it harder to understand the content you are trying to display.
