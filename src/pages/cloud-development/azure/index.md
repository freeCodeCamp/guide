## Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure (formerly Windows Azure) is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed data centers. It provides software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (Paas) and infrastructure as a service (Iaas) and supports many different programming languages, tools and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems.

### Environments

Azure provides a wealth of different environment types across the board including OS platforms such as Windows Server and Ubuntu Server, there are a number of variants that can be chosen such as Ubuntu 14.04 or Ubuntu 16.10, with the ability to use said environments either via the built-in Azure Web CLI or SSH access via your preferred client.

There are varying levels of machine 'sizes' to choose from, ranging from simple barebone low spec machines all the way up multi-GPU and multi-CPU based heavy hitting boxes.
