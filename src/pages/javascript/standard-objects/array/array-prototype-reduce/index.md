## Array.prototype.reduce

The `reduce()` method reduces an array of values down to just one value. 

The single value that is returned can be of any type. 

### Example 1
Transform an array of integers into the sum of all integers in the array. 
```js
    var numbers = [1,2,3]; 
    var sum = numbers.reduce(function(total, current){
        return total + current;
    });
    console.log(sum); 
```
This will output `6` to the console.

### Description
The `reduce()` method has been called the Swiss Army knife, or multi-tool, of array transformation methods. Others, such as `map()` and `filter()`, provide more specific transformations, whereas `reduce()` can be used to transform arrays into any output you desire.

### Syntax
```js
    arr.reduce(callback[, initialValue])
```
- The `callback` argument is a function that will be called once for every item in the array. This function takes four arguments, but often only the first two are used.
    - *accumulator* - the returned value of the previous iteration
    - *currentValue* - the current item in the array
    - *index* - the index of the current item 
    - *array* - the original array on which reduce was called
- The `initialValue` argument is optional. If provided, it will be used as the initial accumulator value in the first call to the callback function (see Example 2 below).

### Example 2
Transform an array of strings into a single object that shows how many times each string appears in the array. Notice this call to reduce passes an empty object `{}` as the `initialValue` parameter. This will be used as the initial value of the accumulator (the first argument) passed to the callback function. 
```js
var pets = ['dog', 'chicken', 'cat', 'dog', 'chicken', 'chicken', 'rabbit'];

var petCounts = pets.reduce(function(obj, pet){
    if (!obj[pet]) {
        obj[pet] = 1;
    } else {
        obj[pet]++;
    }
    return obj;
}, {});

console.log(petCounts); 
```
Output: 
```js
 { 
    dog: 2, 
    chicken: 3, 
    cat: 1, 
    rabbit: 1 
 }
 ```
