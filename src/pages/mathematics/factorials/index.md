## Factorials

Factorials are denoted in mathematics as n! with n being the number you are working with.

The factorial is to multiply it by every intiger lower then it ending at one. If the initial number is negative the result is infinity.

For example:
```
5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120
2! = 2 x 1 = 2
70! = 70 x 69 x 68 x ... x 3 x 2 x 1 = 1.197857e+100
```

One tricky example that many may not know if 0! = 1. For futher proof see the link under More Information.
