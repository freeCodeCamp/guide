title: Add Images to Your Website
---
You can add images to your website by using the `<img>` element, and pointing to a specific image's URL using the `src` attribute.

An example of this would be

```html
<img src="www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg">
```

Note that in most cases, `<img>` elements are self-closing.
