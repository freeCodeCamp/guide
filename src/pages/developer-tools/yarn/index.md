<h1>Yarn</h1>

Yarn is a package manager for your projects. Yarn allows you to use other developersâ€™ solutions to different problems, making it easier for you to develop your software.
Code is shared through something called a package (sometimes referred to as a module). A package contains all the code being shared as well as a package.json file which describes the package.

<h3>There are three options for installing Yarn on Windows.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Download installer</li>
  <li>via Chocolatey</li>
  <li>via Scoop</li>
</ul>
