## React Native - Props 

When you create components, they can be customized with parameters. The creation of parameters are called props 

```js 
import React {Component} from 'react'; 
import {AppRegistry, Image} from 'react-native'; 

export default class CodeCamp extends Components { 
  render () { 
    let pic = { 
    
    }; 
    return (
        <Image source = {pic} style={{width: 193, height: 110}}/> 
        ); 
  }
}

AppRegistry.registerComponent('FreeCodeCampProject', () => CodeCamp); 
```

Props allows you to make a single component that can be used in various places in your app. To refer to them just use 

```js 
this.props
```
 in your 
 ``js
 render
 ```
 function.
