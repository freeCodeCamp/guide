## Application Frameworks

An Application Framework is ready-to-use software for running applications.
Application Frameworks handle common tasks that most applications do.
Application Frameworks save in development time and maintenance, because multiple application vendors pool resources for a common cause.
An Application Framework is more than a collection of its named components.
It includes unique software that integrates its components into a systems paradigm that simplifies common, difficult or repetitive tasks by using libraries of reusable code.
Each application framework solves problems with a unique set of components or in a unique way --addressing resource management for example.
