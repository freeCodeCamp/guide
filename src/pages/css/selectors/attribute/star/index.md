## Star

Star CSS attribute selector or * is used for selecting attributes that contain specific value.

#### Example

If you want to search all anchor links that contain "code" anywhere in the URL value and make them yellow, you can do it like this:

```css
a[href*="code"] {
   color: yellow;
}
```
