title: What to Do if You Speak a Language not Yet Supported by Free Code Camp
---
Translation is an all-or-nothing proposal.

We won't be able to add new languages to Free Code Camp until all of our  
challenges are translated into that language.

In addition to translating these initially, we'll also need to maintain  
the translation as the challenges are gradually updated (we use the  
github issue system to keep record).

If you're able to help us, please join the <a href='https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Translators' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>gitter channel</a>  
and read the <a href='http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/guidelines-for-translating-free-code-camp-to-any-language/19111' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Translation Guide</a>
