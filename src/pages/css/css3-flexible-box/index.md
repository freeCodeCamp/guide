## CSS3 Flexible Box
The Flexbox model provides for an efficient way to layout, align, and distribute space among elements within your document — even when the viewport and the size of your elements is dynamic or unknown.

The most important idea behind the Flexbox model is that the parent container can alter its items' width/height/order to best fill the available space. A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow.<sup>1</sup>
