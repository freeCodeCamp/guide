## Search Algorithms
In computer science, a search algorithm is any algorithm which solves the Search problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain. Examples of such structures include but are not limited to a Linked List, an Array data structure, or a Search tree. The appropriate search algorithm often depends on the data structure being searched, but also on any a priori knowledge about the data.

This kind of algorithms is looking at the problem of re-arranging an array of items in asceding order. The two most clasical examples of that is the binary-search and the mergesort algorithm.
