Steganography differs from cryptography because it involves passing a message, not by encrypting it but, by concealing/hiding it.

For example, in the past, messages were hidden with lemon juice on a sheet of paper or with false letters containing more information than they seemed. Originally, steganography dates back to ancient Greece where records show that a Greek Historian Heredotus (440BC) shaved the hair of his slave to imprint military messages on the skull. As the hair eventually grows back over time, the slave would travel across miles to the intended recipient to later present the information to him. 

Today, computer techniques have further improved these processes through means of images, audio and video files. 
Some suggest that applying steganography over encrypted files can provide an additional layer of security as it combines both sides of the security components. 

<!--StegHide is a program for hiding information in image or audio files.-->
