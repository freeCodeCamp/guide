## Simplifying Square Roots

Simplied Radical form:
Let's say you have the radical SQRT(363), and you need to simplify it into both a nicer looking number and a number that you can use in specific calculations, to do this by trying to find perfect squares within the radical.

So, it's a fact that SQRT(x*y) = SQRT(x) + SQRT(y)
and this fact allows us to seperate the SQRT(243) into pieces

but first, we need to find a factor of 363, tha would allow us to pull a perfect square from it.
Perfect squares include 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144... because each of them has a sqare root that is a whole number

Now, factors of 363 are:
1, 3, 11, 33, 121 and 363

If you look, you can see that 121 is among that list, 121*3 is 363, and we can change the radical to show that:
SQRT(363) = SQRT(121*3)
          = SQRT(121)*SQRT(3)
And we can take the square root of 121, and make it a whole number:
          = 11*Sqrt(3)
And that's your radical.



Simplifying Square roots in the denominator:
Lets' say you have the expression:
   2
-------
SQRT(5)
And you wanted to simplify this by removing the radical from the denominator, well you can do this by multiplying this fraction by:
SQRT(5)
-------
SQRT(5)
Which is equal to one, and you get:
   2      SQRT(5)   2 x SQRT(5)
------- x ------- = -----------  because a square root multiplied by itself is the number in the square, the denominator is now a
SQRT(5)   SQRT(5)        5       whole number, not a radical. The radical still exists in the top, but this is fine in most cases.
