## Minimum Marketable Features

A Minimum Marketable Feature (MMF) is a self-contained feature that can be developed quickly and gives significant value to the user. 

**It is important to note:** Minimum Marketable Feature is not the same as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). They are different concepts. However, both are essential to supporting the idea that Developers should strive for minimum functionality in order to accomplish any given outcome.

Break down MMF to its core components:

**Minimum** - the absolute smallest set of functionality. This is essential for getting any given feature to market quickly

**Marketable** - Selling the end user or organization that the feature has significant value

**Feature** - The percieved value by the end user. What does it give me? Brand recognition? More Revenue? Help cut costs? Does it give me a competative advantage?
