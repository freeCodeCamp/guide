## Head

The `<head>` element contains the metadata of the  HTML document and, with the exception of the `<title>` tag, is not displayed on the browser.

This metadata specifies the document styles sheets, links, scripts, and other meta information.

```html

        <title>This title tag is going to show up on the browser tab.</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Inside the body is where all the content goes</p>
    </body>
