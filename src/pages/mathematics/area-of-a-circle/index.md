The area of a circle is all the space inside a circle's circumference. 

If 'r' is the radius of circle, its area is calculated with formula pi*r<sup>2</sup> where pi is mathematical constant.

pi = 22/7 = 3.141592....

A = pi *r<sup>2</sup>, r is the radius of circle

A = pi * {d<sup>2</sup>/4}, d is the diameter of circle, d=2* r
