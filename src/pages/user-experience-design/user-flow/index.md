WHAT IS USER FLOW?

User flow is the path taken by a prototypical user on a website or app to complete a task. The user flow takes them from their entry point through a set of steps towards a successful outcome and final action, such as purchasing a product.

THE ROLE OF USER FLOW IN WEB & APP DESIGN

The user flow is the basis for content requirements on web pages or app screens. Beginning with an understanding of user needs helps the product team build a user flow and experience that is designed to meet those needs.

For each user flow, the questions you need to consider are:

What is the user trying to accomplish?
What is important to the user and what will give them confidence to continue?
What additional information will the user need to accomplish the task?
What are the user’s hesitations or barriers to accomplishing the task?
The answers to those questions will inform how you design the pages, and determine what content and navigational links to include. If a user’s primary goal is to browse various items, your page or screen will offer different a different design and functionality than it would have if their primary goal is to purchase a product and move on.

EXAMPLES OF USER FLOWS

User flows can take many different forms, depending on the type of website or app you are building. For example, for an ecommerce site, a typical user flow might look like the following:

The user starts on the homepage
From the homepage the user clicks onto a category page
From the category page the user clicks on a product
From the product page the user adds the item to the cart
From the shopping cart the user checks out
From the checkout screen the user completes the purchase
Of course, the above is a very simplified example. In the real world users can take many different paths to purchase. For example, in the example above the user could go back to the category page to view more products instead of going directly to the shopping cart. Or they could use search to navigate the site instead of clicking through the site hierarchy. Or the user could come in from a different page other than the homepage.

Because there are many different paths that users can take, user flows are often modeled as flow charts with nodes for each of the major navigational paths. The purpose of user flow analysis is to identify the main user flows through your app or website, and identify areas where the navigational flow can be improved.
