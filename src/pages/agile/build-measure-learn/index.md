## Build Measure Learn

Agile methodology is about how to build things right. "Build Measure Learn" is about how to build the right thing.

The term comes from the [Lean Startup methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup), popularised by [Eric Ries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ries), the author of [The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Startup-Innovation-Successful-Businesses/dp/0670921602).

**Build Measure Learn** is sometimes referred to as Hypothesis Driven Development. 

### The Premise:
The goal of Build Measure Learn is to *build* a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), *measure* the impact of the MVP and *learn* about whether the Product that is being built is viable, valuable and fulfils the assumed success criteria.
