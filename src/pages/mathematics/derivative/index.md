## Derivative

**Definition** : The derivative of function f(x) with respect to x, represented by f'(x) is defined as:<br/>
      ![Limit formula for derivative](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/DefnOfDerivative_files/eq0006M.gif)<br/><br/>

where h is a infinitely small change in the value of input, represented by the limit function (h is approaching to zero)<br/>

In the above formula, we notice that derivative is just the slope of a tangent of a graph of x at any input value.<br/>

**Important property of function and it's derivative:** <br/>
A function f(x) is differentiable at x = a, if and only if, the function is continuous at f(x=a). <br/>
Conversely, if a derivative of a function exists at a point a, then the function must be continous at f(x=a).

## Properties of Derivatives

1. **Linearity**<br/>
Suppose f(x) and g(x) are differentiable functions and a and b are real numbers. Then the function <br/>

is differentiable as <br/>

2. **Product Rule** <br/>
For a given function h(x) = f(x) * g(x), we can apply the product rule to find the derivative of function h(x) as <br/>

      Please see link in More information (Properties of Derivative) for proof of this property <br/>

3. **Quotient Rule** <br/>
The quotient rule gives the derivative of one function divided by another. Let h(x) = f(x) / g(x) (where g(x) cannot be zero) then the derivative of h(x) can be found using the following: <br/>

4. **Chain Rule** <br/>
The chain rule is used in the case of a function of a function, also known as a composite function or as a composition of functions. Input composite function representation:<br/>

Then the output derivative can be found using the following rule: <br/>
