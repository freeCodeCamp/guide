title: Breakpoints
---
## Overview

A CSS Breakpoint is a specific point in which a website's layout changes, based on a [Media Query](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/css/css3-media-queries) 
becoming active.

Generally, you specify a breakpoint when you want to re-adapt the website's layout to the browser viewport's size; mostly, to the viewport's width.

For example, if your website content looks great on a narrow viewport (like on a smart-phone browser), but it starts to look bad on bigger screens (e.g. maybe the fonts' size are too small and difficult to read), then you might want to introduce a new breakpoint for bigger screens that makes the fonts bigger:

CSS Breakpoints can be considered to be the heart of responsive webdesign because they define how the content behaves or is arranged at
a different device width/scale allowing you to show the best possible layout to the user.

## Setting Break Points

Breakpoints are broadly set on basis of either of the following.

- Breakpoints based on device width.
- Breakpoints based on content.

### Breakpoints based on device width

It's quite apparent that all of our devices donot have same screen widths/ sizes. It is now a design decision to include a set of particular devices and code the css rules accordingly. We already have enough devices to worry about, and when a new one comes out with a different width, going back to your CSS and adding a new breakpoint all over again is time-consuming.

Here's an example 

```
/* ----------- iPhone 6, 6S, 7 and 8 ----------- */

/* Portrait */

@media only screen

and (min-device-width: 375px)

and (max-device-width: 667px)

and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2)

and (orientation: portrait) {

}

/* Landscape */

@media only screen

and (min-device-width: 375px)

and (max-device-width: 667px)

and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2)

and (orientation: landscape) {

}

/* ----------- Google Pixel ----------- */

/* Portrait */

@media screen

and (device-width: 360px)

and (device-height: 640px)

and (-webkit-device-pixel-ratio: 3)

and (orientation: portrait) {

}

/* Landscape */

@media screen

and (device-width: 360px)

and (device-height: 640px)

and (-webkit-device-pixel-ratio: 3)

and (orientation: landscape) {

}
```
> With this approach, you will end up having a huge list of media queries.

### Breakpoints based on Content

This is the most preferred choice while making or writing the breakpoint rules. Because it is easire to adjust your content according a particular layout only when it requires a change.
```
@media only screen (min-width: 768px){
...
}
```
> This breakpoint means the CSS will apply when the device width is 768px and above.


#### You can also set a range with breakpoints,  so the CSS will only apply within those limits.
```
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 959px){

...

}
```

**Note** 
Always try to create breakpoints based on your own content, not devices. Break them to a logical width rather than a random width and keep them to a manageable number, so modifying remains simple and clear.


**CSS breakpoints** are useful when you want to update styles based on the screen size. For example, from a device measuring 1200px width and above, use the `font-size: 20px;`, or else use the `font-size: 16px;`.

What we have started with is from the greater than 1200px, a common laptop screen's width. You may also have noticed that we mentioned 'greater than', meaning that we are in a way using something like an '**if-then**' statement.

Let's turn it into CSS code: 

```css
.text1 {
    font-size: 16px;
}
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
    .text1 {
        font-size: 20px;
    }
}
```

**For our convenience**, we write down the `.text1` basic styling first... then afterwards we will specify the `@media` rules.

**Tip**: you may see on a common CSS Framework called 'Bootstrap', that they have adopted **'min-width' and up** in their Bootstrap v4.0, as compared to their old Bootstrap v3.0 using **'max-width' and down**.
This is only a **preference**, and there is nothing wrong with saying '*this* size and less than' versus '*this* size and greater than'.

It is perfectly fine to use `@media (max-width) {}` . Here is an example: 

```css
.text1 {
    font-size: 20px;
}
@media (max-width: 1199px) {
    font-size: 16px;
}
```


```css
// Normal, basic styles
// that look great on small screens
// but not on bigger screens
body {
  font-size: 16px;
}

// Define a new breakpoint, with a media query.
// In this case, for when the viewport's width
// is at least 512px wide.
@media (min-width: 512px) {
	body {
		font-size: 20px;
	}
}
```


Breakpoints that are based on content as opposed to device are less complicated. Here's a simple snippet that triggers when the device's width is upward of ```code 700px``` roughly smart-phone screen sized

```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 700px) {
  something {
    something: something;
  }
}
```

You can also set a minimum and maximum width, which let's you experiments with differnt ranges. This one roughly triggers between smar-phone and larger desktop and monitor sizes

```code
@media only screen and (min-width: 700px) and (max-width: 1500px) {
  something {
    something: something;
  }
}
```
