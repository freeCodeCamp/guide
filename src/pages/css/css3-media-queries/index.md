## CSS3 Media Queries

Media Queries help you target specific sizes for devices. 

You can target a minimum or maximum size of a screen for the user and elements could be styled differently at these sizes. 

By using the following code all elements in this media query will be styled if they are 960px and below:
```
@media (max-width: 960px) { ... }
```
