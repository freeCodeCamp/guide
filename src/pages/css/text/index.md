## Text

Several properties are provided by CSS to change the look and feel of the text. Various text properties are explained below.

#### Text Color

``` html
<html>
  <body>
    <p>This is an example of CSS text property.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
``` css
p {
    color:red;
 }
```

In the above example, the text `color` of `<p>` element is changed to red. You can also specify the color as RGB values, HLS values, and hex codes (For more information about colors, click [here](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/css/colors)).
  
#### Text Alignment

`text-align` property is used to set horizontal alignment of text. It can take values `left`,`right`,`center`,and `justify`.
``` css
p {
    text-align: center;
 }
```

Here the text is aligned to the `center` ([example](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_text-align)).When `text-align` is set to `justify`,each line is stretched so that every line has equal width, and the left and right margins are straight ([example](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_text-align_all)).
  
#### Text Decoration

``` css
p {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

The `text-decoration` property is used to set or remove decorations from text. The value `text-decoration: none;` is often used to remove underlines from links. Other `text-decorations` include `overline`,`line-through`,and `underline` ([example](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_text-decoration)).
  
#### Text Tranformation

``` css
p {
    text-transform: capitalize;
}
```

The `text-transform` property is used to convert the entire text to `uppercase`,`lowercase` or to `capitilize` each word([example](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_text-transform)).

#### Letter Spacing

The `letter-spacing` property sets the space between characters in a text.
``` css
p {
    letter-spacing: 5px;
}
```

#### Line Height

The `line-height` property sets the space between two lines of text.
``` css
p {
    line-height: 5px;
}
```

#### Word Spacing

The `word-spacing` sets the space between words in a text.
``` css
p {
    word-spacing: 5px;
}
```
