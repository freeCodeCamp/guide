## Feature Based Planning

Feature-based planning is an approach used in release planning. Features and scope take priority over date. Using this approach, release plans are created by estimating the amount of time that will be required to complete a certain defined amount of scope. Often this approach is utilized for new product launches where a minimal or critical amount of feature/function must be delivered in order for the completed product to be considered market worthy.
