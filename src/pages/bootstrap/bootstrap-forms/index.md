## Bootstrap Forms

Create a bootstrap form by wrapping labels and form controls in ```<div class = 'form-group' ></div>```
Add the class ```.form-control```` to all textual ```<input>```, ```<textarea>``` and ```<select>``` elements. By default, bootstrap forms have a width of 100%Â°


Bootstrap has three layouts for forms. Vertical, Horizontal and Inline. 
Vertical forms are the default form setting. 
For horizontal and in-line forms the classes ```.form-horizontal``` and ```.form-inline``` have to be added to the form element respectively.
