title: Docker

Docker is a platform that allows programmers to containerize their projects. By using containers to build, deploy, and run their applications, programmers have greater flexibility and can make their applications more secure, lighter, and faster. 

Containers include all neccessary files and software necessary to run an application, which makes it easy to share within and across teams.  

They can be created in both Linux and Windows environments.
