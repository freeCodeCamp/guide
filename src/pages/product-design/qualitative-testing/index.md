Qualitative Testing encompasses a set of activities used to determine the quality of a system.

In software terms, a domain expert e.g. Test Engineer or User Researcher, uses various techniques to determine the perceived quality of a solution.

These techniques may involve:
### User Interviews
The researcher interviews people fitting the target user persona, asking them various questions regarding their understanding and appreciation of the system under question, with minimal priming. The user is given an introduction and may simply be asked to try to use the system.
During this process, the researcher makes note of the user's explicit responses as well as implicit responses by noticing the tone of response, body language, irritation or delight.

### Surveys
While surveys are generally used to determine statistical information (or it's relevance), they may contain open-ended questions, which a researcher then analyses to determine user perception.

### Personal Judgement
A domain expert may also give direct qualitative feedback based on their experience e.g. a UI designer may clearly see that the color theme on a website creates cognitive dissonance. This feedback is a very valuable part of Qualitative Testing.
