## Tables

The ```<table>    ``` attribute defines a table in HTML, using a series of rows and cells. Instead, each table row is defined with the ```<tr>    ``` tag. Nested within each row are table cells, defines by ```<td> ```. There is no column definition; the number of columns is simply defined by the number of rows within the table.

For instance:
  ```html
  <html>
  <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Favorite Food</th> 
    <th>Favorite Color</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Janet Honeysuckle</td>
    <td>Ice Cream</td> 
    <td>Mint Green</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>George DeSalvos</td>
    <td>Tacos</td> 
    <td>Electric Orange</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</html>
