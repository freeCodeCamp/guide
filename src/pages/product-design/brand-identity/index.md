<strong>A company’s brand identity is the image the comapny wants to present to consumers.</strong>

"A company’s brand identity is how that business wants to be perceived by consumers. The components of the brand (name, logo, tone, tagline, typeface) are created by the business to reflect the value the company is trying to bring to the market and to appeal to its customers. Brand identity is separate from brand image – the term for how consumers actually perceive the brand."<sup>1</sup>
