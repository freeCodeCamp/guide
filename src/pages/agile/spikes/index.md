Spikes are stories that can help lay down the linework for another story or feature later on. Let's say that you are tasked with updating an existing process and adding another step in that process. Since you don't know how the current solution is built, you can create a spike such as "Understand the current solution". When you point the story for actually changing the process, you will have completed this spike and have more information on what exactly that change entails.
