## U Tag

The `<u>` tag denotes misspelled text or proper nouns in Chinese. Text that is wrapped in a `<u>` tag will be underlined in the browser. Because of this, be careful using the `<u>` tag where text could be confused as a hyperlink.

Today, the underline style can be achieved through the `text-decoration: underline` property in CSS.

### Example
```
<body>
  <p>
    Misspelled text that should be underlined goes <u>herre</u>.
  </p>
</body>
```
