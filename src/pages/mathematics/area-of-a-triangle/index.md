As expressed in the above photo, the area, or measurement of the inside surface, is calculated by multipling half the base value by the height value. ^1/_2 b\timesh. 
For example, if the above triangle had a base of 6m and a height of 3m we would calulcate the following: ^1/_2 b = 3m, h = 3m. 3m\times3m = 9m. The area of the triangle would be 9 meters.
