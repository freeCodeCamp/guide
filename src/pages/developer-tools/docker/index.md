## Docker

Docker is an open-source software aimed at facilitating application deployment. 
It offers the possibility to build containers, including an operating system, libraries and all you need to run your application. Therefore, your application can then be deployed on any machine. 
Its lightweight structure enables you to run several containers on the same machine.

Similar to Github, DockerHub offers a wide variety of images (Ubuntu and others), on which containers are built.

## Overview
A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings. Available for both Linux and Windows based apps, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the environment. Containers isolate software from its surroundings, for example differences between development and staging environments and help reduce conflicts between teams running different software on the same infrastructure.
