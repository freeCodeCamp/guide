## Doctype

Similar to when we read any piece of text we need to first determine the language before we can interpret it, so does HTML.

When you write HTML you need to declare <!DOCTYPE> first to let the browser know what kind of html you are using.

## Example
```html
 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 
<head>
 <title>Title of webpage</title>
</head>

<body>
your body content

</body>

</html> 


```
