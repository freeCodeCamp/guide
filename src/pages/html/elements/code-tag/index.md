## Code Tag

Web Developers use the `<code>` element in HTML when defining a piece of computer source code.

**Example:**
```html
<p>This is how you declare a JavaScript variable:<br/>
<code>var i = 0;</code>
</p>
```

The example above is a piece of HTML showing you how to declare a JavaScript variable using the `<code>` element within a paragraph of regular text. By default, the text in `<code>` is displayed in monospace.

**Example 2:**
```html
<p>After your fork the freeCodeCamp-guides repository, copy it to your local machine by running:</br>
<code>git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/guides.git</code>
</p>
```

This example is also a piece of HTML showing you how to clone a fork of the freeCodeCamp-guides repository.
