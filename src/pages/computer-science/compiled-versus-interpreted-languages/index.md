## Compiled Versus Interpreted Languages
A Compiled Language is one that is completely changed into machine code before exicution. Compilation usually takes longer than interpretation but once compliled it is ready to exicute.

An interpreted language is translated line by line into one or more subrutines of already compiled machine code. An interpreter gives more flexibility but opens the program up to runtime errors and code injection attacks.

In theory any programming language can be interpreted or compiled, what differs is the implementation.
