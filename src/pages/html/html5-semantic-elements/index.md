## HTML5 Semantic Elements

**Semantic elements in HTML** are elements responsible for meaning of information in the webpage, not for how that information is styled.  
For example, `<b>` tag makes letters bold, but that is only visual difference from other letters in the text. It has no semantic meaning. 
On the other hand, letters surrounded by `<strong>` tag might look like bold too, but it is semantic element indicating the importance and seriousness of the content. A screen reader, for example, when identifies content depending on the semantic will change the tone or intonation. 
It is also important for a browser to better differentiate types of data to better display content on different devices.
And even for a developer it is easier to understand markup structure written using semantic elements. 

Some of the semantic elements in HTML5:
+`< article>`
+`<aside>`
+`<details>`
+`<figcaption>`
+`<figure>`
+`footer>`
+`<header>`
+`<main>`
+`<mark>`
+`<nav>`
+`<section>`
+`<summary>`
+`<time>`
