## Brand Identity

Make sure you create a brand not only with the logo. Brand identity is about all usages and applications a brand may have passing its essence with ease.

It's a manual showing where the identity may be inserted, based on design patterns.

When creating a brand identity, understand about your client, about its aspirations, its vision of the world and the problem it is helping to solve.

Apply that identity to things that matter and make sense to that brand.
