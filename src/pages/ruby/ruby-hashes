## Ruby Hashes

Hashes are a collection of unique keys and their values. They are similar to arrays, but can are not tied to using an index as a key.
To make an hash in Ruby, use curly brackets, use a colon after each key, and separate key-value pairs with commas:

```ruby
my_hash = { name: "Free Code Camp", website: "https://www.freecodecamp.org/" }
```

Alternatively you can use create a hash with .new, with an option to provide a default value:

```
my_hash = Hash.new
my_hash = Hash.new(0) # with default value set to 0
```

You can add to a hash in a similar way to an array, except you define the key.

```ruby
my_hash[:non_profit] = true 
```

You can access the elements of an array with square brackets and key:

```ruby
my_hash[:name] # "Free Code Camp"
my_hash[:website] # "https://www.freecodecamp.org/"
my_hash[:non_profit] # true
```
