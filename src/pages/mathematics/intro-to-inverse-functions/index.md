## Intro to Inverse Functions

Say you were trying to reflect y=3x over the line y=x. What would be the equation of the line? As you can see in the image below, it would be y=1/3x. But why is that so? If you swap x and y with each other and solve for y, you can find that the equation would be the same. This is what would be called a inverse function.
