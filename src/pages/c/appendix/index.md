# C: An Appendix
Because C is such a low-level language, there are a lot of terms that come up that aren't found in a lot of other languages. Here's an appendix to making understanding them easier.

## Compilation
The compilation is the process of taking the human-readable code and turning it into machine-readable code. This process is performed by a compiler.

## Compiler
A compiler is a program that compiles code, meaning it changes it from something machine-readable into something human-readable.

## Debugging/Debugger
Debugging is the process of removing errors ("bugs") from your code. A debugger is a helpful tool that makes that easier.

## GNU+Linux
GNU+Linux is the technically accurate term for what is commonly referred to as "Linux". Linux is a kernel- it's a set of programs that allow software to interact with hardware. When combined with GNU, it becomes an operating system, which allows a person to interact with it.

## GUI
Graphical User Interface. A GUI will allow you to interact with a program by pointing and clicking rather than having to type in commands.

## Header Files
Header files are libraries that exist in the top (header) of your C program.

## IDE
Integrated Development Environment. It's an editor for code and will have useful tools for making writing code easier, like a debugger.

## Human-readable
The human-readable code is code that can be read by a person- it's not in binary or machine code.

## Libraries
Libraries are useful sets of code that give more functions and features in the language.

## Machine Code
Machine code is the code that the machine can understand. Remember that computers use numbers, not English, to run.

## Newline
A newline is what gets printed when you hit Enter, and is an example of a whitespace character.

## Whitespace
Whitespace is the characters that you don't see when you type but are there anyway. For example, you can't see spaces, but there is a lot here. Newlines are also whitespace characters, as are tabs.

# C: C Language Overview
C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.

In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.

The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons −

    Easy to learn
    Structured language
    It produces efficient programs
    It can handle low-level activities
    It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms

Facts about C

    C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.
    C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.
    The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).
    The UNIX OS was totally written in C.
    Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.
    Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.
    Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.

Why use C?

C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be −

    Operating Systems
    Language Compilers
    Assemblers
    Text Editors
    Print Spoolers
    Network Drivers
    Modern Programs
    Databases
    Language Interpreters
    Utilities

C Programs

A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.

This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.
