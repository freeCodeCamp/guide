## Interaction Design

## What is Interaction Design? 

Interaction Design, often abbreviated as IxD is concerned with the practice of designing interactive digital products such as websites, apps, softwares systems, and/or services. However, Interaction Design also comes handy when designing non-digital products. Interaction Design mainly focuses on behavior. 

Below are five distinct charecteristics of Interaction Design as defined by the eminent industrial designer and IDEO founder – Bill Moggridge (Shared from Interaction Design Foundation – IDF):

## 1.	Design involves changing situations by shaping and deploying artifacts
Design is about transformation and the means available for the designer to bring the change in a particular situation is ultimately the designed artifact.

## 2.	Design is about exploring possible futures
This sounds too obvious to mention, but from an educational perspective, it shouldn’t go unnoticed, especially since it entails a basic difference in orientation. Analytical and critical research emphasis on that what already exist, while design revolves and speaks about what could be.

## 3.	Design entails framing the “problem” in parallel with creating possible “solutions” 
This charecterstic speaks about how the situation gets changed when we have designed something. It follows the notion that the situation in which the design is used is no longer same compared to when we were designing it.

## 4.	Design involves thinking through sketching and other tangible representations
When a designer is working on designing a possible solution, they are not just copying images from their inner eyes, their drawings or sketches are actually the experiements and prototypes of what turns insights into strenghts and possible changes.

## 5.	Design addresses instrumental, technical, aesthetical and ethical aspects throughout
Every prototype that is being designed introduces considerations and tradeoffs in all these dimensions, and there is no obvious way in which they can be sequenced. This notion holds equally for interaction design – Technical decisions influences the aesthetic qualities of the resulting interaction, instrumental choices on features to offer have ethical repercussions, and so on.
