## Self Organization

Scrum teams are said to be self organising. This means that the work done and generally the way it is done is left up to the team to decide - they are
empowered by their managers to guide themselves in the ways that makes them most effective. The members of the team (Delivery Team, Product Owner, and
Scrum Master) regularly inspect their behaviors to continuously improve. 

During Sprint Planning the team will look at the product backlog (which will have been prioritised by the product owner) and decide which stories they
will work on in the upcoming sprint and the tasks which will need completing to mark the story as Done. The team will estimate a score or size for the
story to denote effort. 

During a sprint it is up to the members of the team to pick up sprint backlog stories to work on, generally they will pick ones they think they can
achieve. Due to it being a self organising team, there should be no assigning a task to a team member by someone else.
