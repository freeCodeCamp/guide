## Ruby

Ruby is a programming language created to maximize developer happiness and readability. It is the high level object-oriented scripting language that powers Ruby on Rails, which remains one of the more popular web development frameworks. Due to its focus on simplicity and productivity, Ruby has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. Ruby borrows heavily from Perl and the class library is essentially an object-oriented reorganization of Perl's functionality. Ruby also borrows from Lisp and Smalltalk.
