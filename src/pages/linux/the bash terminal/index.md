## What is Bash?
Bash is the default terminal on Unix OSes and MacOS. Bash was created by Brian Fox due to his disatisfaction about the orignial Bourne Shell. Bash stands for Bourne-Again Shell. Fox began coding Bash on Jan 10, 1988. The frist beta was released by 1989. Soon after, it picked up steam and became the most popular shell terminal. In the Windows 10 Anniversary update, Microsoft introduced the Bash terminal as a beta feature and in the Windows 10 Fall Creator Update, it has been moved to an official package.
