A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised learning technique from the field of machine learning applicable to both classification and regression.
Rooted in the Statistical Learning Theory developed by Vladimir Vapnik and co-workers at AT&T Bell Laboratories in 1995, SVMs are based on the principle of Structural Risk Minimization.
