## Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator

Concatenate means to link together. Think of the '+' operator like a chain linking strings together; add the strings just like you add numbers. Make sure your spelling is correct! Take note of spaces between words.

    var str = "Good " + "job!" // It says "Good job!"
    var abc = "Good" + "job!" // It says "Goodjob!"
