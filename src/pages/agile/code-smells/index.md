## Code Smells

A code smell is a surface indication that the code in question is problematic (bad quality, technical debt ...) and should be refactored.
Although code smells are not bugs initially (they indicate weaknesses in design), they are a risk of future bugs and future bigger problems as the system evolves.

There are tools, such as Checkstyle, PMD and FindBugs for Java, to automatically check for certain kinds of code smells.
