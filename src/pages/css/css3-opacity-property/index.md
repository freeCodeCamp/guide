## CSS3 Opacity Property



This property controls how 'see-through' an element is.

___
If you set the property of an element to zero it will be completely transparent.  You won't be able to see it at all.  If you set it to '1'  it will be opaque and you won't be able to see anything behind it. 

```css

.transparent{
opacity: 0.0;
}

.verySeeThrough{
opacity: 0.3;
}

.slightlySeeThrough{
opacity: 0.7;
}

.opaque{
opacity: 1.0;
}

```

[This simple example ](https://codepen.io/Tlandis/pen/xXMRGM)shows how you might use opacity with a hover effect.

Opacity is often used to draw the user's attention to elements and  focus on important parts of a page.
