It is included as “vi” with most UNIX systems, which also includes Apple’s macOS. Vim is a major improvement over its predecessor <em>vi</em>, which was developed over 40 years ago, and it is still being used.</p>\n<p>Vim is rock stable and boasts many features including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>persistent, multi-level undo tree</li>\n<li>extensive plugin system</li>\n<li>support for hundreds of programming languages and file formats</li>\n<li>powerful search and replace</li>\n<li>integrates with many tools</li>\n<li>built-in macro support for automation text manipulation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the main differences that Vim (and its predecessor, <em>vi</em>) have over other editors like <em>nano</em>, is that it is a <em>modal editor</em>, which means that it have several modes of operation. For example, the editor starts in <em>Navigation Mode</em>, which allows you to quickly move around the document (or, more accurately <em>blazingly fast</em>). In this mode, you can enter commands to interact with your document, like using <code>:i</code> to enter <code>insert mode</code>, <code>:q</code> to quit, <code>/&#x3C;text></code> to search text, among others. </p>\n<p>The modal part of Vim is what makes it really powerful.
