# The Java For Loop

The `for` loop give you a compact way to iterate over a range of values.

```java
for (initialization; expression; increment){
    // Statements
}
```

*   `initialization` - Initializes the loop and is executed just once, at the beginning.
*   `expression` - Evaluated at the beginning of each iteration. If the `expression` evaluates to `true`, `Statements` will get executed.
*   `increment` - Invoked after each iteration through the loop. You can increase/decrease the value of variables here.

```java
int iter_For;
for (iter_For = 0; iter_For < 10; iter_For++){
    System.out.print(iter_For + " ");
    // Iterated 10 times, iter_For 0,1,2...9
}
System.out.println("iter_For Value: " + fooFor);
```

Output:
```
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    iter_For Value: 10
```
