## HTML Entities
<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
Some characters are reserved in HTML.  
If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags. 
Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.  
A character entity looks like this:  
```
&entity_name;  
OR  
&#entity_number; 
```
To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60;

Some of the most used HTML entities are:
```
space - &nbsp; or &#160;
<     - &lt;   or &#60;
>     - &gt;   or &#62;
&     - &amp;  or &#38;
```
