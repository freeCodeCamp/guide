## Definition of Mode

The mode (also referred to as "modal value") is the number which appears most often in a set of numbers.

To calculate the mode, first put the numbers in order and then count how many of each there are - the number which occurs most often is the mode of that set of numbers. For example:

```
Here's a set of numbers:
{ 9, 4, 3, 5, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8 }

Here's that set in order:
{ 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 8, 9 }

The mode is 4 because it appears most often.
```

You can have more than one mode in a set. Two modes is called bimodal, and more than two modes is called multimodal.

```
Set: { 3, 5, 5, 7, 8, 8 }
Modes: 5 and 8

The most times a number appears in this set
is twice - both 5 and 8 appear twice so they
are the modal values of this set.
```
