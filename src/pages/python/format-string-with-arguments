In Python3.5, you are able to format strings with position and keyword arguments using the 'format' method. The arguments
are entered into the string as curly brackets, who values are interpolated by the arguments you set in the format method
based on the order.

>>> str1 = "My name is {}".format("Tim")
My Name is Tim
