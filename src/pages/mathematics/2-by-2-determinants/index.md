## 2 by 2 Determinants

The determinant of a square matrix is a scalar value linked to many fundamental properties of the matrix itself, such as invertibility. 

Given a 2 by 2 square matrix:

![2x2Matrix](https://github.com/viso-gio/HostedImages/blob/master/2x2Matrix.png?raw=true)

its determinant is computed as:

![2x2det](https://github.com/viso-gio/HostedImages/blob/master/det2x2Matrix.png?raw=true)
