## Area of a Ellipse

Area of an ellipse of semi-major axis of length A and semi-minor axis of length B is **pi*A*B** (These semi axes are half the lengths of, respectively, the largest and smallest diameters of the ellipse).

For example, the following is a standard equation for such an ellipse centered at the origin:
                                **(x^2/A^2) + (y^2/B^2) = 1.**

The area of such an ellipse is    **Area = Pi * A * B**

One way to see why the formula is true is to realize that the above ellipse is just a unit circle that has been stretched by a factor A in the x-direction, and a factor B in the y-direction. Hence the area of the ellipse is just A*B times the area of the unit circle.
