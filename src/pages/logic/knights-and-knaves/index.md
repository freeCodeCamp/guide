## Knights and Knaves

Knights and Knaves are a type of logic problem where the reader evaluates a series of statements to determine who is lying and who is telling the truth.

Typically the reader is told that they are visiting an island where all the inhabitants are either Knights (who only make true statements) or Knaves (who only make false statements). The reader then hears a series of statements from a few island inhabitants and is asked to determine which of the island inhabitants are Knights and which are Knaves. 

#### Example Knight and Knave Puzzle: 

You are visiting a far away island for a vacation. Your guidebook has helpfully told you that everyone who lives on the island is either a Knight or a Knave. Knights can be trusted to always tell the truth. Knaves will always tell lies.

You greet a man and a woman on the street. The woman tells you that the man is a Knave.

The man then tells you that isn't true. He is a Knight. The womman can't be trusted be trusted because she is a Knave. In fact, he has heard her say that she is a Knave just last week!

Is the woman a Knight or a Knave? Is the man a Knight or a Knave?

#### The Solution:

Whether the woman is a Knight or a Knave can't be determined right away. She has stated that the man is a Knave. If the man's statements are true he is a Knight and it will be clear that the woman has lied about him and that she is a Knave. If his statements are false, he is a Knave and the reader will know that the woman told the truth and is therefore a Knight. 

When the man's statements are evaluated, it becomes clear that he is a Knave. On this particular island, no one would ever say that they are a Knave. Knights would truthfully say that they are Knights. Knaves would claim to be Knights because they always lie. So the young man could not have heard the woman claim that she is a Knave. This means his statement is false. The woman can be trusted, she is a Knight, and he did not hear her say that she is a Knave.

The man made false statements and is therefore a Knave. The woman's statement about the man is true, so therefore she is a Knight.
