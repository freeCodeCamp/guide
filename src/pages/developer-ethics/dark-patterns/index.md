Examples include:

* <a href='https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/disguised-ads' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>**Disguised Ads**</a> – Adverts disguised as other kinds of content or navigation, in order to get users to click on them.

* <a href='https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/forced-continuity' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>**Forced Continuity**</a> – Silently charging a user's credit card without warning at the end of a free trial.

* <a href='https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/friend-spam' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>**Friend Spam**</a> – A website or app asks for a user's email or social media permissions under the pretence it will be used for a desirable outcome (e.g. finding friends), but then spams all the user's contacts in a message that claims to be from that user.

* <a href='https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/hidden-costs' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>**Hidden Costs**</a> – The user reaches the last step of a checkout process, only to discover some unexpected charges appear, e.g. delivery charges, tax, etc. that were not disclosed prior to processing the user's payment.

* <a href='https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/misdirection' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>**Misdirection**</a> – The design purposefully focuses a user's attention on one thing in order to distract their attention from another.

* <a href='https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/price-comparison-prevention' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>**Price Comparison Prevention**</a> – An online retailer makes it hard for visitors to compare the price of an item with another item, so they cannot make an informed decision.

* <a href='https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/privacy-zuckering' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>**Privacy Zuckering**</a> – Users are tricked into publicly sharing more information about themselves than they really intended to. Named after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

* <a href='https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/roach-motel' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>**Roach Motel**</a> – The design makes it very easy for users to get into a certain situation, but then makes it hard for them to get out of it (e.g. a subscription).

* <a href='https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/sneak-into-basket' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>**Sneak Into Basket**</a> – A user attempts to purchase something, but somewhere in the purchasing journey the site sneaks an additional item into their basket, often through the use of an opt-out radio button or checkbox on a prior page.

* <a href='https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/trick-questions' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>**Trick Questions**</a> – Users are made to respond to a question, which, when glanced upon quickly appears to ask one thing, but if read carefully, asks another thing entirely.
