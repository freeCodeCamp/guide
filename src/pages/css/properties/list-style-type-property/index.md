## List Style Type Property

This property changes the appearance of the list item marker. The default value is `disc`. You can also give a value of `none` if you don't want item markers shown. It is part of the shorthand `list-style` property. 

The following is a group of lists that indicate some possible keywords and their respective results. A more complete list can be found on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type">MDN</a>, but be aware that browser support may limited for some newer keywords.

*Note: `upper-latin` and `upper-alpha` produce the same results, as do `lower-latin` and `lower-alpha`. The only difference is that `upper-latin` and `lower-latin` are not supported in IE6 or IE7.
