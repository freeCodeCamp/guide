## Coordinate Plane

A coordinate plane is a plane in which a coordinate system exists, such that all points in the plane can be unique determined by an order tuple (most commonly a pair). A coordinate plane, as with a coordinate system in any number of dimensions, helps to transform problems in geometry to problems in algebra, and vice versa. 

The coordinate plane is often associated with Descartes. Hence, it is also known as Cartesian coordinates system.

The 2-dimensional plane consists of a horizontal x-axis and a vertical y-axis.

The point (0, 0) marks the origin of the plane. Any point to the right or left of the origin has a positive or negative x-coordinate respectively. Correspondingly, any point above or below the origin has a positive or negative y value.
