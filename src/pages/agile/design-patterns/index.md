## Design Patterns

A design pattern is a repeatable solution to a software engineering problem. Unlike most program-specific solutions, design patterns are used in many programs. Design patterns are not considered finished product; rather, they are templates that can be applied to multiple situations and can be improved over time, making a very robust software engineering tool. Because development speed is increased when using a proven prototype, developers using design pattern templates can improve coding efficiency and final product readability.
