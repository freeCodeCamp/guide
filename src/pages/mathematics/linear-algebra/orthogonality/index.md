# Orthogonality

## Vectors
A set of vectors is **orthogonal** or **perpendicular** if their dot product is 0.

In the example below, the two vectors are not orthogonal because their dot product is not 0.

## Matrices
Matrix A is **orthogonal** if AA<sup>T</sup> = I, where A<sup>T</sup> is the transpose of matrix A and I is the identity matrix. It follows that A<sup>-1</sup> = A<sup>t</sup>, where A<sup>-1</sup> is the inverse of matrix A.
