## XAML
Extensible Application Markup Language, or XAML (pronounced "zammel"), is an XML-based markup language developed by Microsoft. XAML is the language behind the visual presentation of an application that you develop in Microsoft Expression Blend, just as HTML is the language behind the visual presentation of a Web page.
Creating an application in Expression Blend means writing XAML code, either by hand or visually by working in the Design view of Expression Blend.
WPF uses XAML for constructing user interfaces (UI) in markup instead of in a programming language such as C#.

#### Example XAML Block
```xml
<Canvas xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/client/2007"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml">
  <TextBlock>Hello, world!</TextBlock>
</Canvas>
```
