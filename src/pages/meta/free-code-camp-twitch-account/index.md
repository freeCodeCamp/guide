title: Free Code Camp Twitch Account
---
Twitch is a popular live streaming service that Free Code Camp moved away from

As much as we enjoyed using this service, streams were few and far between and therefore it wasn't serving it's purpose.

We have decided to move our focus onto using <a href='https://www.youtube.com/freecodecamp' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>YouTube</a> for broadcasting our monthly summits and pair programming as well as uploading tutorials and hikes.

You can find our YouTube chat room here: <a href='https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/YouTube' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>FreeCodeCamp/YouTube</a>

You can find the old twitch channel here: <a href='https://www.twitch.tv/freecodecamp' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>twitch.tv/freecodecamp</a>

~~FreeCodeCamp uses Twitch.tv to broadcast live streams. This can be anything from live pair programming to our monthly Summit, where big news events and new developments are announced.~~

~~All levels of coders are encouraged to stream on the FreeCodeCamp twitch channel. If this is something that would interest you, please contact the twitch mods on gitter.~~
