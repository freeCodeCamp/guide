There are two main ways to get the TypeScript tools:

Via npm (the Node.js package manager)
By installing TypeScript’s Visual Studio plugins
Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 include TypeScript by default. If you didn’t install TypeScript with Visual Studio, you can still download it.

For NPM users:

```javascript
npm install -g typescript
```
