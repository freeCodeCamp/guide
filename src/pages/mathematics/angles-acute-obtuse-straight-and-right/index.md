## Angles: Acute, Obtuse, Straight and Right

There are four types of angles depending on their size in degrees. These are:
<ul>
  <li>Right angles</li>
  <li>Straight angles</li>
  <li>Acute angles</li>
  <li>Obtuse angles</li>
</ul>

<h3>Right angles</h3>
Right angles are angles that have a measure of exactly 90°. For example, the angle at the corner of a square or rectangle is a right angle. An example of a right angle is below:

<h3>Straight angles</h3>
Right angles are angles that have a measure of exactly 180°. For example, a straight line has a straight angle. An example of a straight angle is below:

<h3>Acute angles</h3>
Acute angles are angles that have a measure of less than 90°. For example, a capital letter "A" has an acute angle. An example of an acute angle is below:

<h3>Obtuse angles</h3>
Obtuse angles are angles that have a measure of more than 90° but less than 180°. For example, a clock showing 5 o'clock has an obtuse angle. An example of an obtuse angle is below:

<h3>Examples</h3>
<h4>Example 1</h4>
What is the measure of the largest integer acute angle?
<pre>Since acute angles are angles with a measure less than 90°, the largest integer acute angle will have
a measure of 89°.</pre>

<h4>Example 2</h4>
What is the measure of the smallest integer obtuse angle?
<pre>Since obtuse angles are angles with a measure larger than 90°, the smallest integer obtuse angle will have
a measure of 91°.</pre>

<h4>Example 3</h4>
What is the measure of the angle in a capital letter "L", and what type of angle is it?
<pre>The measure of the angle in a capital letter "L" is 90°, and the angle is a right angle.</pre>
