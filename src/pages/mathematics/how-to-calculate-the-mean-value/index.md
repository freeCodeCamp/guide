## How to Calculate the Mean Value

A Mean is nothing but average of numbers.

#### Examples

1. What is the mean of 10 , 2 , 3?
A. mean = (10 + 2 + 3) / 3,
        = 15 / 3,
        = 5.
   So , the mean of 10 , 2 , 3 is  5.

The mean is just another word for the average of the numbers. It is easy to calculate: add up all the numbers, then divide by how many numbers there are. In other words it is the sum divided by the count.

Example 

Add the numbers: 6 + 11 + 7 = 24
Divide by how many numbers (there are 3 numbers): 24 / 3 = 8
The Mean is 8
