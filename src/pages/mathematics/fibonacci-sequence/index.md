## Fibonacci Sequence
<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
The **Fibonacci Sequence** is an ordered list of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. For example, 

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...`

More generally, Fibonacci numbers are governed by the recurrence relation:
`F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`
where the first two values are, by definition, `0` and `1` (or, sometimes `1` and `1`).
