## A Tag

The `<a>` tag or _anchor_ element creates a hyperlink to another page or file. In order to link to a different page or file the `<a>` tag must also contain a `href` attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

The text between the opening and closing `<a>` tags becomes the link.

By default, a linked page is displayed in the current browser window unless another target is specified. 

#### Example:

```html
  <a href= "https://guide.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>
```

An image can also be turned into a link by enclosing the `<img>` tag in an `<a>` tag.

#### Example:

```html
  <a href= "https://guide.freecodecamp.org/"><img src="logo.svg"></a>
```
