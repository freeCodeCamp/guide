## Code Smells

A Code smell is like a smelly person on the bus. That person is alive and well, but something went a bit wrong (either he/she was too busy to take a shower or ate something horrid and can't contain the gas exhaust).

With smelly code everything is working, however there is an underlying problem which slows down the software/app, or make the code overly complicated and thus unreadable.

### Definition

Code smell in computer programming code refers to any surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system.

It is important to understand that code smell is not a bug, the person on the bus is still alive, the code is still working but not as well as it could be. 

#### Examples

1. Duplicated code - Blocks of code that have been replicated across the code base
2. Large classes - Classes having too many lines of code

Both these smells indicate that there is no modularity in the design.
