## SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the most common tool used to manipulate data in a relational database (often referred to as a "SQL database"). It is a querying language, not a programming language. The main function of SQL is to insert, update, delete and query data. 

SQL is commonly pronounced as "sequel." Its most popular variants are Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft Access, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite - a version of SQL which is commonly used for prototyping.

SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database. Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are: Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, Ingres, etc. Although most database systems use SQL, most of them also have their own additional proprietary extensions that are usually only used on their system. However, the standard SQL commands such as "Select", "Insert", "Update", "Delete", "Create", and "Drop" can be used to accomplish almost everything that one needs to do with a database.
