## Area of a Square

Area of a square is defined as the space enclosed by four sides of a square. A square is a regular quadrilateral, which means it has four equal sides and four equal angles (90-degree angles, or right angles). It can also be defined as a rectangle in which two adjacent sides have equal length.

#### Terminology
Diagonal - the distance from opposite corners of a square. The corners are 90-degrees.

Perimeter - the sum of the length of four sides in a square. The four sides are equal in a square.

#### Formula
###### Given length of sides of the square
Area of square = length x length

   <i>or simply</i>

Area of square = length<sup>2</sup>

###### Given diagonal of the square
Area of square = (diagonal)<sup>2</sup> / 2

###### Given perimeter of square
Area of square = (perimeter/4)<sup>2</sup>

#### Examples

1. Given length of one side of square is 8 units:

   Area = 8 x 8 = 64 units<sup>2</sup>
   
2. Given area of a square is 100 units<sup>2</sup>:

   Length = <span>&#8730;</span>100 = 10 units
   
3. Given diagonal of square is 25 units:

   Area = 10<sup>2</sup> / 2 = 50 units<sup>2</sup>
  
4. Given perimeter of a square is 20 units:

   Area = (20 / 4)<sup>2</sup> = 25  units<sup>2</sup>
