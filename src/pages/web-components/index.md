#### What are web components?

Compostable, reusable, customizable and semantic are the descriptors often used in documentation and various talks. A way to semantically build reusable code in html, css and javascript. The key it seems is the standards it uses to implement all the fancy descriptors.

More than hype though, is the reality that if we can make the code have more use, we can worry less about getting the css or html right every time we want to achieve a certain look or functionality. We can import html, use custom elements, the shadow DOM, and a template element to tie it together.

To me learning about web components goes nicely with ES6 and progressive web apps. Because for the first time, regardless of what framework is used, you can understand the web as a platform to creature unique experiences that are easily translated from one size screen to the next. This is all thanks to web components being standardized and following these specifications.

>
