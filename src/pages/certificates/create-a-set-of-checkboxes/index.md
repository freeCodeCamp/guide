title: Create a Set of Checkboxes
---
Checkboxes are a type of input.

*   Each of your checkboxes should be nested within its own label element.
*   All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.

Here's an example of a checkbox:

```html
<label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>
```
