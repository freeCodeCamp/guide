What is Docker?

Docker is a Container Base System. In Docker, applications run in containers. Now the question is why containers? The answer to this question is simple. We see in a real world that if a country wants to export any luggage to another country, they put them into a container then they ship that container either by road or through a dock to another country.

Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud. 

Todayâ€™s businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained by existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing and increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application architectures. Docker enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and innovation.
