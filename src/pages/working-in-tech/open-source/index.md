## Open Source

Open source software is any type of software that is available to the public to use, modify, or download for free. Anyone is capable of creating an open source project.

Open source projects are legally made open through a creative license. They are changed, maintained, or abandoned by their creators at any time. Many open source projects have contributors that volunteer to add and edit code, and a growing number of open source projects are taking a major place among the most popular software available today.


In short, Open source softwares are of **lower cost**, **higher security** and **better quality** when compared to propreitary software.

One of the biggest Open Source projects is Linux.
