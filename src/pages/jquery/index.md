## jQuery

jQuery is the most widely-used JavaScript library, and is used in more than half of all major websites. 

jQuery makes web development easier to use by providing a number of 'helper' functions. These help developers to quickly write DOM (Document Object Model) interactions without needing to manually write as much JavaScript themselves.
