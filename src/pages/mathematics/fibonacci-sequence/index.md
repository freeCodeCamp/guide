## Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is an integer sequence (an ordered list of whole numbers) where, after the first two numbers, each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers in the series.

Starting with 0 and 1, the sequence begins 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34...and can continue on forever.

Written as a rule, the Fibonacci sequence looks like this:

If you start with a rectangle divided into two squares (each representing 1 unit length) and then keep adding a square the length of the rectangle's longest side, you get the Fibonacci spiral (which  approximates the [golden spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spiral)).
