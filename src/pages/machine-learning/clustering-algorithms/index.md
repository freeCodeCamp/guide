## Clustering Algorithms

Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).

Clustering algorithms have the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory data mining, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including machine learning, pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, and computer graphics.

## Types of Clustering Algorithms:
1. Connectivity-based clustering (hierarchical clustering)
2. Centroid-based clustering (k-means clustering)
3. Distribution-based clustering 
4. Density-based clustering 

## Examples 
1. Alogmerative clustering
2. k-means clustering
3. k- mediods clustering
4. Partition Clustering
