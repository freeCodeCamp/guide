###### Vector spaces

##### Introduction
A non empty set V is said to be a vector space (V,+,.) over a field F if these hold
* (V,+) is an abelin group ie (V,+) is commutative over addition
* For every v in V, a in F, av is in V
* For u and v in V and a and b in F : a(u+v)=au + av, (a+b)v=av + bv, a(bv)=(ab)v, 1.v=v
