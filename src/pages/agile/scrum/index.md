## Scrum

Scrum is one of the methodologies under the Agile umbrella. 
The practice revolves around 
- A set of roles (delivery team, product owner, and scrum master)
- Ceremonies (sprint planning, daily standup, sprint review, sprint retrospective, and backlog grooming)
- Artifacts (product backlog, sprint backlog, product increment, and info radiators and reports).
- The main goal is to keep the team aligned on project progress to facilitate rapid iteration.

**Theory**

Scrum was created by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka, it was conceived to be an way of developing projects continuously, deploying builds weekly or biweekly. With this amount of deployments, the team is able to get feedback constantly and re-evaluate the priorities of the project, besides the fact of seeing your work done being a huge performance and motivation boost.
