title: Registering Your Nonprofit to Raise Donations Through Free Code Camp Commit
---
Our commit program will feature a single nonprofit by default, and give campers the option of browsing through a list of other nonprofits they can pledge toward if they want.

If you'd like to be added to our list of nonprofits that our campers can commit to, please email us at team@freecodecamp.com with the following information:

*   The URL of a square photo of at least 300x300px that represents your organization (preferably an action shot of what your organization does with people in it)
*   A direct link to your donate page, or a page with a an embedded donation button (your donation page needs to have the option of recurring monthly payment, and allow increments of $5, $10, $25 and $50).

If we accept you, we will give you a special URL that leads directly to your nonprofit's Commit page. You can share in your social media to spur people to pledge to your nonprofit through Free Code Camp Commit.
