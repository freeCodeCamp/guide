## Social Engineering

Social Engineering is the art of gaining access to a secured system or resource by exploiting human behavior. It involves tricking people into breaking normal security procedures. Most attack vectors rely heavily on leveraging technical skills to find gaps in the security system. Social Engineering relies heavily on having a good understanding of human psychology. Thoroughly researching the target before an attack makes social engineering a powerful tool in the hands of the attacker. 

#### Traits of a good Social Engineering Hacker

* Demonstrates high emotional intelligence
* Intuitive understanding of human psychology
* Charming and persuasive
* Patient and observant
* Adept at predicting human behavior based on exploiting the human need to be helpful, curious, greedy and vain

#### Some examples of Social Engineering hacks

* Baiting: Leaving a malware infected USB at a coffee shop in the hope that someone is curious enough to plug it in and check it out. Once the person plugs the USB in, malware is installed on their computer.

* Pretexting: Telling lies to gain access to private information. An example would be impersonating a bank officer and asking people for personal information to 'confirm their account'.

* Phishing: Sending an email which looks like it is from a trusted source to bait the user into clicking a link (to install malware) or replying with private information.
