 * Replace the default server renderer. This is useful for integration with
 * Redux, css-in-js libraries, etc. that need custom setups for server
 * rendering.
 * @param {Object} $0
 * @param {function} $0.replaceBodyHTMLString Call this with the HTML string
 * you render. **WARNING** if multiple plugins implement this API it's the
 * last plugin that "wins". TODO implement an automated warning against this.
 * @param {function} $0.setHeadComponents Takes an array of components as its
 * first argument which are added to the `headComponents` array which is passed
 * to the `html.js` component.
 * @param {function} $0.setPostBodyComponents Takes an array of components as its
 * first argument which are added to the `postBodyComponents` array which is passed
 * to the `html.js` component.
 * @param {function} $0.setBodyProps Takes an object of data which
 * is merged with other body props and passed to `html.js` as `bodyProps`.
 * @param {Object} pluginOptions
 * @example
 * // From gatsby-plugin-glamor
 * import { renderToString } from "react-dom/server"
 * import inline from "glamor-inline"

/**
 * Called after every page Gatsby server renders while building HTML so you can
 * set head and body components to be rendered in your `html.js`.
 *
 * Gatsby does a two-pass render for HTML. It loops through your pages first
 * rendering only the body and then takes the result body HTML string and
 * passes it as the `body` prop to your `html.js` to complete the render.
 *
 * It's often handy to be able to send custom components to your `html.js`.
 * For example, it's a very common pattern for React.js libraries that
 * support server rendering to pull out data generated during the render to
 * add to your HTML.
 *
 * Using this API over [`replaceRenderer`](#replaceRenderer) is preferable as
 * multiple plugins can implement this API where only one plugin can take
 * over server rendering. However, if your plugin requires taking over server
 * rendering then that's the one to
 * use
 * @param {Object} $0
 * @param {function} $0.setHeadComponents Takes an array of components as its

 * @param {function} $0.setBodyProps Takes an object of data which
 * is merged with other body props and passed to `html.js` as `bodyProps`.
 * @param {Object} pluginOptions

 * import helmet from "react-helmet"

 * exports.onRenderBody = ({ setHeadComponents }, pluginOptions) => {
