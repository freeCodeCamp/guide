## Area of a Ellipse

A Circle is stretched by factor **r**(radius) in all directions.

Hence its area is caluculated by formula A= pi *r<sup>2</sup> where pi is a mathematical constant, pi = 22/7 = 3.141592....

An Ellipse is just like a Circle, but is stretched by a factor **a** in the x-direction, and a factor **b** in the y-direction. 
**a** is semi-major axis length and **b** is semi-minor axis length.

Hence Ellipse area is calculated by formula A = pi *a *b
