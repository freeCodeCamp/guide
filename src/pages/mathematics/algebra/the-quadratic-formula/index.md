## The Quadratic Formula

<img alt='An example of a quadratic formula. ' src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Quadratic_formula.svg">

Mathematicians and Programmers use the quadratic formula to solve the zeroes quadratic equations, such as x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0. This equation can be very helpful in calculus, probability, and all sorts of disciplines.

Any quadratic formula is in the form ax + bx^2 + c, and if you want to calculate the zeroes of the equation (i.e. a solution for x such that ax + bx^2 + c = 0), then you can use the quadratic formula to find them. The quadratic formula is in words is negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4 times ac, and it's all over 2a.
