## Area of a Rectangle

In Euclidean plane geometry, a rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. It can also be defined as an equiangular quadrilateral, since equiangular means that all of its angles are equal (360°/4 = 90°). It can also be defined as a parallelogram containing a right angle. A rectangle with four sides of equal length is a square

T = l*b

#### Terminology

**l:** length of a rectangle

**b:** breadth of a rectangle

**T:** Area of a rectangle

#### Examples

1. **l** = 10 units, **b** = 5 units, **T** = (b * h)  = **50 square units**

2. **l** = 20 units, **b** = 2 units, **T** = (b * h)  = **40 square units**
