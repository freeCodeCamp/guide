## Feature Based Planning

**Feature Based Planning** is a planning methodology that can be used to decide when to release software based on the features that will be delivered to the customers, rather than an arbitrary deadline based release.

In this method of release planning, teams decide what feature/features should be prioritised. Based on the scope of these features the team can then predict when the next release can be deployed.
