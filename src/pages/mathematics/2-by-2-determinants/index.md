## 2 by 2 Determinants

To find the determinant of a 2 by 2 matrix, you would cross-multiply each cell with its diagonal and subtract the second product from the first product. <br />For instance, if you had this matrix *A* <br />![A 2 by 2 vector](https://github.com/ShawnToubeau/Images/blob/master/2%20by%202%20vector.PNG) <br /> The determinant would be det(*A*)=(a11*a22)-(a12*a21)
