## Binary Decimal Hexadecimal Converter

A Binary Decimal Hexadecimal Converter is a tool used to convert numbers between the three different numeral systems. This can take the form of a conversion table, an online tool, or built in functions in many programming languages.

### Conversion table
This is an example of a Binary Decimal Hexadecimal Conversion table:

| Binary       | Decimal      | Hexadecimal  |
| :----------- | :----------- | :----------- |
|     0000     |      00      |      00      |
|     0001     |      01      |      01      |
|     0010     |      02      |      02      |
|     0011     |      03      |      03      |
|     0100     |      04      |      04      |
|     0101     |      05      |      05      |
|     0110     |      06      |      06      |
|     0111     |      07      |      07      |
|     1000     |      08      |      08      |
|     1001     |      09      |      09      |
|     1010     |      10      |      0A      |
|     1011     |      11      |      0B      |
|     1100     |      12      |      0C      |
|     1101     |      13      |      0D      |
|     1110     |      14      |      0E      |
|     1111     |      15      |      0F      |

Each number appears in the same row as its equivalents in the other two numeral systems.
A larger table will contain more values.
This tool is suitable for quick lookup but becomes impractical for larger numbers.

### Online converters
Binary Decimal Hexadecimal Converters can be found on various websites, all of which function in more or less the same way.
You begin by identifying the type of number you want to convert from. Then, you enter the number in the relevant field. The equivalents in the other numeral systems will appear on screen.
