You can check out the following links to get a PHP server and MYSQL for creating a local envinonment for PHP to run:
Web Server: https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi
Database: https://www.mysql.com/downloads/

### PHP Parser Installation
Before you proceed it is important to make sure that you have proper environment setup on your machine to develop your web programs using PHP.

Type the following address into your browser's address box.
```shell

```
If this displays a page showing your PHP installation related information then it means you have PHP and Webserver installed properly.
