# Area of a Triangle

## Formula
There are 3 different ways to calculate the Area of a Triangle

### When the height and base of the triangle are known

__A = 1/2 * B * H__

*Where A is the area, B is the base and H is the height*

### When 2 sides and the included angle are known

__A = 1/2  a * b * sin C__

*Where a and b are 2 sides of the triangle and  C is the included angle*

### When all 3 sides of the triangle are known

__A = &radic;(s*(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))__

__s = (a+b+c)/2__

*Where a, b and c are the 3 sides of the triangle and s is half the perimeter of the triangle*

### Examples

Example 1: Example: What is the area of a triangle with a base of 12cm and height of 15cm?

Solution:

A = 1/2 * B * H

A = 1/2 x 12 x 15

A = 90 <span>cm<sup>2</sup></span>

Example 2: What is the area of a triangle with sides  7cm & 10 cm and an included angle of 25ยบ

Solution:

A = 1/2 * a * b * sin C

A = 1/2 x 7 x 10 sin 25ยบ

A = 14.8 <span>cm<sup>2</sup></span>

Example 3: What is the area of a triangle with sides of 3cm, 4cm and 5cm

Solution:

s = (a+b+c)/2

s = (3+4+5)/2

s = 6cm

A = &radic;(s*(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))

A = &radic;(6*(6-3)(6-4)(6-5))

A = 6 <span>cm<sup>2</sup></span>
