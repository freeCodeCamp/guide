## Self Organization

Scrum teams are said to be self organising. This means that the work done and generally the way it is done is left up to the team to decide.

During Sprint Planning the team will look at the product backlog (which will have been prioritised by the product owner) and decide which stories the will work on in the upcoming sprint and the tasks which will need completing to mark the story as Done. The team will estimate a score or size for the story to denote effort. 

During a sprint it is up to the members of the team to pick up sprint backlog stories to work on, generally they will pick ones they think they can achieve. Due to it being a self organising team, there should be no assigning a task to a team member by someone else.

Defining self-organizing teams

A group of motivated individuals, who work together toward a goal, have the ability and authority to take decisions and readily adapt to changing demands. Let's look at some important ingredients of a self-organizing team:

* They pull work for themselves and don't wait for their leader to assign work. This ensures a greater sense of ownership and commitment.
* They manage their work (allocation, reallocation, estimation, reestimation, delivery, and rework) as a group.
* They still require mentoring and coaching, but they don't require "command and control."
* They communicate more with each other, and their commitments are more often to project teams than to the ScrumMaster.
* They understand requirements and aren't afraid to ask questions to get their doubts clarified.
* They continuously enhance their own skills and recommend innovative ideas and improvements.

Five essentials of self-organizing teams

* Competency: Individuals need to be competent for the job at hand. This will result in confidence in their work and will eliminate the need for direction from above.
* Collaboration: They should work as a team rather than as a group of individuals. Teamwork is encouraged.
* Motivation: Team motivation is the key to success. Team members should be focused and interested in their work.
* Trust and respect: Team members trust and respect each other. They believe in collective code ownership and are ready to go the extra mile to help each other resolve issues.
* Continuity: The team should be together for a reasonable duration; changing its composition every now and then doesn't help. Continuity is essential for the team.
