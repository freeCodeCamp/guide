## CSS3 Media Queries

A media query is a CSS3 technique used to include a block of CSS properties when a condition is true. Media queries are primarily used to make webpages look good on smaller screens.

e.g.,
```css
@media (max-width: 992px) {
  p {
  	color: green;
  }
}
```

In the example above, the p tags on the webpage will turn green when the screen width is less than or equal to 992px.
