## Quantitative Surveys

<Use quantitative research methods in market research when:

You want to know “how many” and/or “how often”
You want to profile a target audience by determining what proportion of the audience has certain behaviors, behavioral intentions, attitudes, and knowledge related to the health concern, and whether specific determinants predict behaviors at a statistically significant level.
You conduct quantitative market research generally involves:

Surveying a large group of people (usually several hundred), and
Using a structured questionnaire that contains predominantly closed-ended, or forced-choice, questions.
To design and conduct a quantitative survey, you should consider getting input from a survey expert. Together you will need to consider issues related to designing an appropriate sample, using valid and reliable measures, and conducting a pretest before the survey study is launched. Most surveys are custom studies designed to answer a specific set of research questions. Some surveys are omnibus studies, in which you add questions about your topic to an existing survey.

Surveys can be conducted face-to-face, by mail or telephone, or by computer. They can be self-administered or administered by an interviewer. Tools such as computer-assisted telephone interviewing or touch-screen surveys via a Web site can be useful.

Pros

When the survey involves a convenience sample (e.g., a mall intercept study), data can be collected and analyzed fairly quickly
When the survey involves a statistically valid random sample, the results from the sample can be generalized to the entire population if the response rate is high enough
Surveys can provide reliable (i.e., repeatable) direction for planning programs and messages
Surveys can be anonymous, which is useful for sensitive topics
Like qualitative research methods, surveys can include visual material and can be used to pretest prototypes
You can generalize your findings beyond your participant group.
Cons

They have a limited ability to probe answers
People who are willing to respond may share characteristics that don’t apply to the audience as a whole, creating a potential bias in the study
They can be very costly.
Common Uses

Assess the proportion of your target audience within a community
Assess the proportion of a target audience that practices a behavior
Assess the proportion of a target audience that recalls a message.>
