title: Appending Variables to Strings
---
Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals `+=` operator.

## Example

    var anAdjective = "awesome!";
    var ourStr = "Free Code Camp is ";
    ourStr += anAdjective;
