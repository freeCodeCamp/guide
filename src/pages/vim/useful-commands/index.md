## Useful Commands

### Moving in "normal" mode

Vim allows a wide range of movement in normal mode.

Basic one character movements (using key from the keyboard homerow):
- **h**   move one character left
- **j**   move one row down
- **k**   move one row up
- **l**   move one character right

As many vim commands, row movement can be prefixed by a number to move several lines at a time:
- **4j**  move 4 rows down
- **6k**  move 6 rows up

Basic word movements:
- **w**   move to beginning of next word
- **b**   move to previous beginning of word
- **e**   move to end of word
- **W**   move to beginning of next word after a whitespace
- **B**   move to beginning of previous word before a whitespace
- **E**   move to end of word before a whitespace

As said above all these commands can be prefixed with a number to specify the number of word to used:
-- **2w** move to the beginning of the "second" next word

Beginning/End of line movement:
- **0**   move to the beginning of the line
- **$**   move to the end of the line

### Saving
1. Press `Escape` to make sure you're in `normal mode`;
2. Type in `:w` ("w" stands for "write");
3. Press `Enter`.

## Exiting Vi, Vim, Nvim, Gvim
1. Press escape to get you into "normal" mode
2. To exit, type `:q` but if you made any changes in file Vim gives error code `E37` in this case:
- To save and exit, type `:wq`
- To ignore changes and exit, type `:q!`

**OR**
- Type ZZ (save and quit)

## Setting line numbers
1. Press escape to get you into "normal" mode
2. Type `:set number`, press enter

To set line numbers on by default:
1. Open/create the vim configuration file with `vim ~/.vimrc`
2. Add the line `set number`, press enter

## Bare minimum functionality

Most likely you'll find yourself in "normal" mode, it allows you to enter commands by pressing the colon `:` key.
To get here from other modes you can type `ctrl + c` or `escape`.

To edit text and move around in a familiar way press `i`, for "insert" mode.
Try to move around with the arrow keys in "insert" mode.

Depending on the configuration, you may enter a file browser by typing and entering the command `:e .` in "normal" mode. The 'e' stands for edit, and the period for the file or directory.

## Searching a file in Vim

When in normal mode (press the `escape` key to make sure), you can search for any term in the document by typing `/`, followed by the term you're looking for, and then pressing `enter`. For example, type `/hello` and press `enter` to search for the word "hello" in the current file.

You can skip to the next occurrence of your search term by pressing `n`, or the previous occurrence by pressing `N`.

## Pasting blocks of code

Very often you will find yourself looking for solutions to problems, and finding someone has written a block of code that does exactly what you want.
If you try to copy and paste the code directly into Vim you might find that the code is weirdly formatted or hasnt't been pasted correctly.
This is due to the fact that vim reads each character that you paste one after the other, meaning any key-combinations that activates a Vim shortcut will be executed and Vim will try (and fail) to automatically indent the pasted code.

To overcome this you can use Vim's **Paste mode** which you can activate by entering normal mode (press `escape` or `crtl + c`) and type `:set paste`, then press ENTER.
You are now in *paste* mode.
You can then enter insert mode with `i` and paste the block of text/code without any issues!
To return to regular Vim without paste mode you can enter normal mode (`escape` or `crtl + c`) and type `:set nopaste`, and press ENTER
