## Link

The `:link` CSS pseudo-class is used to target all unvisited elements (e.g. anchor `<a>` elements) that have an `href` attribute, even if the `href` has an empty value.

General Syntax:

```css
target:link
```

## Example

```css
/* Selects any <a> that has not been visited yet */
a:link { 
    color: red;
}
```
