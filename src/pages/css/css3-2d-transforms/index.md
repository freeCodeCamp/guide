## CSS3 2d Transforms

The _transform_ property allows you to visually manipulate an element by skewing, rotating, translating, or scaling.
Here are the possible values of the _tranform_ property:

* scale(): affects the size of the element. This also applies to the font-size, padding, height, and width of an element, too. It’s also a a shorthand function for the scaleX and scaleY functions.
* skewX() and skewY(): tilts an element to the left or right, like turning a triangle into a parallelogram. There is no shorthand skew property.
* translate(): moves an element sideways or up and down.
* rotate(): rotates the element clockwise from its current position.
* matrix(): a function that is probably not intended to be written by hand, but combines all transforms into one.
perspective(): doesn’t affect the element itself, but affects the transforms of descendent elements' 3D transforms, allowing them all to have a consistent depth perspective.
