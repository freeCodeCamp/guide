## Area of a Rectangle

The area of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying the length of the two different sides together.

For example, if you have a rectangle that is 2cm by 4cm, then you can work out the area:

2cm x 4cm = 8cm²

If you want to find the missing side of a rectangle, given the area and the lenght of one side, you simply divide the area by the given lenght of the given side or think of what number (in this case we will call the number "A") multiplies with the length of the know side to result the area.

For example, if you have a rectangle that has an area of 10cm², and you are given the length of one side which is 2cm, then you can find the length of the other side:

10cm² / 2cm = 5cm

10cm² = A x 2
