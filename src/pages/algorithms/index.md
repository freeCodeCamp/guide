## Algorithms

An algorithm is like a recipe. It's a series of steps you take in order to achieve a specific outcome.

Some common types of algorithms include sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and compression algorithms.

freeCodeCamp's curriculum heavily emphasizes creating algorithms. This is because learning algorithms is a good way to practice programming skills. Interviewers most commonly test candidates on algorithms during developer job interviews due to the facts that a good program cannot be written without a good Algorithm. Algorithm is important to a programmer the way a house-plan is important to a bricklayer.
