## Web Safe Fonts

A web safe font is any fonts that are preinstalled on the majority of the computers that you would ever want to be able to see your site.
So for instance if you look at the link below you will see in the top left corner two different fonts Arial and Arial Black pretty boring right. However, they are preinstalled on about 96% to 98% of all Windows and Mac computers combined. So these are safe fonts thats why you see them so often. If you continue looking at this chart you will see several fonts that have 98% coverage or Windows or Mac but only 3% coverage for the other operating system. These are not Web Safe Fonts. 

##Web Fonts Are The Answer##

In order for you to be able to use whatever fonts you want without worrrying about web safe fonts you need to be able to load Web Fonts. Web Fonts are simply a call to google to display the text in the correct font-family. So you simply embed a line of code between your '''<head></head>''' tags from Google.com/fonts. 
##Google Fonts##
Go to the Google fonts link above and in the search box type Roboto for example that's the Roboto font. Put your cursor over the text and you will see a red regular 400 appear click on that. It means just normal weight text. In the top right corner push the plus button. Now search for Noto Sans and go down to bold 700 and click the plus sign. What this does is it adds both those fonts and font weights to a line of code for your to add to your site. At the base of your monitor you will see a black box that says 2 families selected click on the box. Copy the code that starts like this '''<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Noto+Sans:700|Roboto" rel="stylesheet">''' and paste it in the head section of your website now whenever someone goes to your site they will see the fonts your mean them to see whether they were on their machines or not.
