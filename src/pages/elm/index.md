## Elm

Elm is a domain-specific, purely functional programming language that compiles into Javascript. This programming language is statically typed, and was developed with an emphasis on usability, performance, and robustness. Elm was built by Evan Czaplicki in 2012, and was influenced by Haskell, Standard ML, and OCaml among others. It also helped to inspire the popular state management tool, Redux.

Elm has a small but expressive set of language constructs, including traditional if-expressions, let-expressions for local state, and case-expressions for pattern matching.As a functional language, it supports anonymous functions, functions as arguments, and partial application (currying) by default. Its semantics include immutable values, stateless functions, and static typing with type inference. Elm programs render HTML through a virtual DOM, and may interoperate with other code by using "JavaScript as a service".
