## Docker

Developers utilize Docker as a type of virtual machine for the following

1. application deployment
1. running other applications using containters

Docker is lightweight, and does not create a whole virtual machine.

Docker will use the same Linux kernel as the system that it is on.

this allows applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer
