## Footer Tag

The `<footer>` tag is used to define the footer for a section or document. The footer element usually contains information such as copyright, contact, sitemap, and documents related to the section or page.

### Example:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <!-- The main page contect would populate this area. This area has been left blank for the purpose of demonstrating the footer use. -->
    <footer>
      &copy; 2017 &mdash; ACME &mdash; All rights reserved.
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```
