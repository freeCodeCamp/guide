## CSS3 Gradients


With CSS3 gradients you are able to display smooth transitions from one color to the next.

There are two types of CSS3 gradients:

* Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)

* Radial Gradients (defined by their center)

## CSS3 Linear Gradients

To create a linear gradient in CSS3 you need to define a minimum of two color stop points. Color stop points are the colors you want to render your transitions with. You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect. The default direction is top to bottom.

## Linear Gradient Example
![left to right linear gradient](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v80qhr4zd623wi2/linear_left_right.PNG?raw=1)
```
header {
    background: linear-gradient(to right, green, white);
}
```
This rule will apply a gradient from left to right starting from green and ending in white.

## Angled Linear Gradient

For extra control over the direction of your gradient, you can define an angle instead of one of the predefined directions (to bottom, to top, to right, to left, to bottom right, etc.)

## Angled Gradient Example
![45 degree linear gradient](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3zaopbqw07vvtil/angled_linear_gradient.PNG?raw=1)
```
header {
    background: linear-gradient(45deg, yellow, red);
}
```
This rule will apply a gradient at a 45 degree angle starting from yellow and ending in red.

## CSS3 Radial Gradients
A radial gradient is defined by its center point.

To create a radial gradient the minimium requirements are that you define at least two color stops.

The default shape is an ellipse.

## Radial Gradient Example 
![default radial gradient with three colors](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t22blpoh6i9730w/basic_radial.PNG?raw=1)
```
header {
    background:  radial-gradient(red, yellow, green);
}
```
This rule will apply a radial gradient starting from a red ellipse center then turning yellow and finally green.

=======

CSS3 gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.

Earlier, you had to use images for these effects. However, by using CSS3 gradients you can reduce download time and bandwidth usage. In addition, elements with gradients look better when zoomed, because the gradient is generated by the browser.

CSS3 defines two types of gradients:

* Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
* Radial Gradients (defined by their center)

### CSS3 Linear Gradients

To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among. You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.

#### Syntax
    background: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...);

##### Linear Gradient - Top to Bottom (this is default)
The following example shows a linear gradient that starts at the top. It starts red, transitioning to yellow:

#### Example
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#grad1 {
    height: 200px;
    background: red; /* For browsers that do not support gradients */
    background: -webkit-linear-gradient(red, green); /* For Safari 5.1 to 6.0 */
    background: -o-linear-gradient(red, green); /* For Opera 11.1 to 12.0 */
    background: -moz-linear-gradient(red, green); /* For Firefox 3.6 to 15 */
    background: linear-gradient(red, green); /* Standard syntax (must be last) */
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h3>Linear Gradient - Top to Bottom</h3>
<p>This linear gradient starts at the top. It starts red, transitioning to yellow:</p>

<div id="grad1"></div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions do not support gradients.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

##### Linear Gradient - Left to Right
The following example shows a linear gradient that starts from the left. It starts red, transitioning to yellow:

#### Example

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#grad1 {
    height: 200px;
    background: red; /* For browsers that do not support gradients */
    background: -webkit-linear-gradient(left, red , green); /* For Safari 5.1 to 6.0 */
    background: -o-linear-gradient(right, red, green); /* For Opera 11.1 to 12.0 */
    background: -moz-linear-gradient(right, red, green); /* For Firefox 3.6 to 15 */
    background: linear-gradient(to right, red , green); /* Standard syntax (must be last) */
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h3>Linear Gradient - Left to Right</h3>
<p>This linear gradient starts at the left. It starts red, transitioning to yellow:</p>

<div id="grad1"></div>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions do not support gradients.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

#### Linear Gradient - Diagonal

You can make a gradient diagonally by specifying both the horizontal and vertical starting positions.

The following example shows a linear gradient that starts at top left (and goes to bottom right). It starts red, transitioning to yellow:

#### Example

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#grad1 {
    height: 200px;
    background: red; /* For browsers that do not support gradients */
    background: -webkit-linear-gradient(left top, red, green); /* For Safari 5.1 to 6.0 */
    background: -o-linear-gradient(bottom right, red, green); /* For Opera 11.1 to 12.0 */
    background: -moz-linear-gradient(bottom right, red, green); /* For Firefox 3.6 to 15 */
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, red, green); /* Standard syntax (must be last) */
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h3>Linear Gradient - Diagonal</h3>
<p>This linear gradient starts at top left. It starts red, transitioning to yellow:</p>

<div id="grad1"></div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions do not support gradients.</p>
