## Supplementary Angles
Two angles which sum up to 180&deg; are called supplementary angles.

Supplementary angles don't have to be next to each other, just so long as the total is 180&deg;. Here's an example:

![Parallel lines a and b with line t through them, creating 8 angles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pranabendra/articles/master/Supplementary-angles/images/sup2.png)

As `a` is parallel to `b`, <b>angles</b> "`3`" and "`6`" sum up to 180&deg;. Hence, they are supplementary angles.
