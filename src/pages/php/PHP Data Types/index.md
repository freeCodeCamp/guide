title: PHP Data Types

### Data Types

Each variable in a progarmming language has an associated data type.
Each data type requires different amounts of memory and has some specific operations which can be performed over it. 

 ### PHP Data Types
 
PHP supports the the following data types:
 1.`Integers` − are whole numbers, without a decimal point, like 515.
 
 2.`Doubles` − are floating-point numbers, like 3.159 or 149.1.
 
 3.`Booleans` − have only two possible values either true or false.
 
 4.`NULL` − is a special type that only has one value: NULL.
 
 5.`Strings` − are sequences of characters, like 'PHP supports string operations.'
 
 6.`Arrays` − are named and indexed collections of other values.
 
 7.`Objects` − are instances of programmer-defined classes, which can package up both other kinds of values and functions that are specific to the class.
 
 8.`Resources` − are special variables that hold references to resources external to PHP (such as database connections).
 
 The first five are simple types, and the next two (arrays and objects) are compound - the compound types can package up other arbitrary values of arbitrary type, whereas the simple types cannot.
