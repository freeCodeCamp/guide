title: Hash Tables  
----  

The ideal hashtable is merely an array of some constant size; the size depends on the application where it will be used. The hashtable contains key values with pointers to the corresponding records. Thee basic idea of a hashtable is that you have to place a key value into a location in the hash table; the location will be calculated from the key value itself. This one-to-one correspondence between a key value and an index in the hash table is known as address calculation indexing or more commonly hashing.
