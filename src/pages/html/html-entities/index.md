## HTML Entities

When a developer needs a character to be displayed on a web page that is not on the keyboard or that is an HTML reserved character HTML entities can be used. An HTML entity is written where the symbol or character would normally be typed in the HTML, but encoded in a specific format.  This format consists of the ampersand(&) followed by either the entity name or number, and ended with a semicolon(;).  If the entity number is use it must also be preceded with a pound sign(#).

HTML entities are used to replace reserved characters. If you use the less than (<) or more than (>) character in your text, your browser might confuse the character for part of an HTML tag.

Common HTML character entities include:

    space             &nbsp;      &#160;
<   less than         &lt;        &#60;
>   greater than      &gt;        &#62;


  &*entity_name*;<br>
  &#*entity_number*;
