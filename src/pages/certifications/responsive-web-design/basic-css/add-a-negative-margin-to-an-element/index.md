## Add a Negative Margin to an Element

Margin is the spacing between the border of an element and other elements on the page.
  
  •There is spacing from the top, right, bottom, and left. 

  •The number is in [css units](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css_measurement_units.htm)
  
 For example, to adjust the margin of an element to be negative you could use:
 
```css
.example {
margin: -10px;
}
```

<b>To adjust the padding of an individual element</b> use:
padding: `-10`px;
