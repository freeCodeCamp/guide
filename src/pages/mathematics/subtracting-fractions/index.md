There are 3 simple steps to subtract fractions

Step 1. Make sure the bottom numbers (the denominators) are the same.

Step 2. Subtract the top numbers (the numerators). Put the answer over the same denominator.

Step 3. Simplify the fraction (if needed).

Example 1: Subtract 3/4 - 1/4

            Step 1. The bottom numbers are already the same. Go straight to step 2.

            Step 2. Subtract the top numbers and put the answer over the same denominator:
                        3/4 −  1/4  =   (3 − 1)/4  =   2/4

            Step 3. Simplify the fraction:
                        2/4 =  1/2

Example 2: Subtract 1/2 - 1/6

           Step 1. The bottom numbers are different.
           To make the bottom numbers the same, multiply the top and bottom of the first fraction (1/2) by 3 and now our question looks            like this:
                        3/6	−	 1/6
           The bottom numbers (the denominators) are the same, so we can go to step 2.
           
           Step 2. Subtract the top numbers and put the answer over the same denominator:
                       3/6 −  1/6  =   (3 − 1)/6  =   2/6
                       
           Step 3. Simplify the fraction:
                      2/6 =  1/3
