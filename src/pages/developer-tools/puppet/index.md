<sup>Puppet is an open-source software configuration management tool.</sup> You use it by reporting the state of the system; the report is stored in files called Puppet Manifests. Puppet Manifests files are used to compare against the system. If there are any differences, Puppet reports these to you. There are two versions of Puppet available, Puppet Enterprise and Open Source Puppet. Some benefits of Puppet are: flexible because it is open source, automates repetitive tasks, and it was built to be cross-platform.
