DevOps is a the mix between Development and Operations. It aims to automate the product pipeline and to ease cooperation between developers and operators.

This section contains articles introducing technologies used in DevOps.


The focus on the developer/operations collaboration enables a new approach to managing the complexity of real world operations. I believe the operations complexity breaks down into a few main categories: infrastructure automation, configuration management, deployment automation, log management, performance management, and monitoring. Below are some tools I have used to help solve these tasks.

There is no clear roadmap to become a devops engineer but most people suggest that you have some operations background in the sense of understanding mundane sysadmin tasks like provisioning new server, installing packages, securing server, because in the Devops world you no longer have to build a server from scratch but you have to have the problem solving skills at max to work with different enviroments.

the Devops is supported via automation stuff like configuration (ansible,puppet,yaml) and orquestration( docker, docker swarm,kubernetes,etc).
