## Remote Versus Onsite

There are two main work environments: onsite and remote.

### Onsite Work

Onsite work is what you might think of when you think of a 9-5 job. When you're onsite, you may either be in your company's office or at a client's office. Either way, you're in the same physical location as the rest of the people with whom you work.

### Remote Work

Remote work occurs when team members work in separate physical locations. You can work from anywhere: your home (no commute!), a co-working space (sometimes paid for by your employer), or even a beach in Thailand. Often your only restriction is that you have internet access.

Because in-person communication occurs less frequently (if at all), remote teams often rely more on communication software like Slack and Skype.

Remote teams may host regular company retreats so team members can meet and hang out.

### The "In-Between"

Some companies are 100% onsite, and some are 100% remote. But, it's not unusual to find companies or teams that allow you to work remotely a day or two out of the week. This allows you to experience some of the benefits of remote work, without being remote all the time.

Some companies also have a physical office where you can go to work if you'd like, but allow you to work wherever.
