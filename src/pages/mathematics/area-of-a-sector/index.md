## Area of a Sector
A sector is the portion of a circle enclosed by two radii and one arc, where the smaller area is known as the Minor and the larger area is known as the Major sector.

Minor sector shaded in green. 
*L* is the arc length.
*θ* is the angle in radians.
*r* is the radius.

#### The Area of a sector can be obtained by multiplying the circle's area by the ratio of the angle *(θ°)* and *2π (360°)* as follows:
## A = *πr<sup>2</sup> * (θ°/360)*

## Example:
A circle has a radius of 5 cm. Calculate the area of a sector when the angle made by the radii is 60°

A = *(22/7) * 5<sup>2</sup> * (60°/360°)*

A = **13.095 cm<sup>2</sup>**
