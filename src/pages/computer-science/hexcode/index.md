## Hexcode

HexCode are a way to specify colors on computers. HexCode's achieve this by specifying the amount of red, green and blue that is needed to form the colors in hexadecimal (hence the name).


Computers display all the colors that they can by combining red, green and blue. These colors are also called as primary colors, as combining them in different proportions creates all the colors that you can see on the display.

Computer Display consists of pixels, each pixel consist of a red, green and blue component. The intensity of a particular color from a pixel is controlled by a number. So if a pixel has a 8 bit for each of the red, green, and blue component, then each color's intensity can be varied from 0-255.        

Thus 0 for red, 0 for green and 0 for blue represent no intensity for red, green, and blue which is pure black. This can be written in binary as 00000000 00000000 00000000. If you convert each of the red, green and blue components into hexadecimal you get 00 00 00, which is generally written in CSS and such as #000000.

Similarly to get pure blue you can set 0 for red, 0 for green and 255 (the largest value) for blue. Which when written in binary is 00000000 00000000 11111111, which when converted to hexadecimal is #0000FF.

Thus you can generate all possible 8-bit colors and represent them in hexadecimal by changing each of the 6 hexadecimal digits from #000000 to #FFFFFF which will get you 16^6 = 16777216 colors.
