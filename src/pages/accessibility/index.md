## Accessibility
<strong>Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web</strong>.

More specifically, Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and that they can  contribute to the Web. Web accessibility also benefits others, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/soc.html#of" shape="rect">older people</a> with changing abilities due to aging.

Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that  affect access to the Web, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities. The document "<strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/Overview.html" shape="rect">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a></strong>" describes how different disabilities affect Web use and includes scenarios of people with disabilities using the Web.

Web accessibility  also <strong>benefits</strong> people <em>without</em> disabilities. For example, a key  principle of Web accessibility is designing Web sites and software that are flexible to meet different user needs, preferences, and situations. This <strong>flexibility</strong> also benefits people <em>without</em> disabilities in certain situations, such as people using a slow Internet connection, people with "temporary disabilities" such as a broken arm, and people with changing abilities due to aging. The document "<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/Overview" shape="rect">Developing a    Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization</a>" describes  many different benefits of Web accessibility, including <strong>benefits for organizations</strong>.
