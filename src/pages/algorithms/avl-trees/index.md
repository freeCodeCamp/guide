## AVL Trees

AVL trees are height self balancing trees. In short that means that they won't loose their time complexity during operations such as insert, deletion or search, those will ALWAYS be O(log n). This is achieved by performing rotations when the tree is unbalanced. 

How to determine if a tree is balanced? In AVL trees we have to calculate for every node this value called BalanceFactor(x), of a node, x: height(x.left) - height(x.right). Now for each node, the height of the left and right sub trees can differ by no more than 1. |BalanceFactor(x)| <= 1.
