## Latent Dirichlet Allocation
LDA represents documents as mixtures of topics that spit out words with  probabilities. In other words Latent Dirichlet Allocation  is a generative model of natural language processing. It allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups. Those groups explain why some parts of the data are similar. For example, let's assume observations are words collected into documents. it posits that each document is a mixture of a small number of topics. Thus each word's creation is connected to one of the document's topics.
