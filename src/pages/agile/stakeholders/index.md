## Stakeholders

The Stakeholders are the people that will benefit from your project. It is up to the Product Owner to understand the outcome required by the Stakeholders, and to communicate that need to the Delivery Team.
Stakeholders may be made up from any of the following
- Users
- Customers
- Managers
- Funders / investors

Their participation in the project is essential for success.

For example, when your team is performing the Sprint Review meetings, the demonstration of the project is for the stakeholders, and their feedback is captured and added to the backlog.
