MoSCoW is a coarse-grain method to prioritise (categorise) Product Backlog Items (or requirements, use cases, user stories ... depending on the methodology used).
MoSCoW is often used with timeboxing, where a deadline is fixed so that the focus must be on the most important requirements. 
The term MoSCoW itself is an acronym derived from the first letter of each of four prioritization categories (Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have):

* **Must have**: Critical to the current delivery timebox in order for it to be a success. It is typically part of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
* **Should have**: Important but not necessary for delivery in the current delivery timebox. 
* **Could have**: Desirable but not necessary, an improvement.
* **Won't have**: Least-critical, lowest-payback items, or not appropriate at this time.

By prioritizing in this way, a common definition of the project can be reached and stakeholders' expectations set accordingly. Note That MoSCoW is a bit lax about how to distinguish the category of an item and when something will be done, if not in this timebox.
