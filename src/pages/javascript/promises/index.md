## Promises
JavaScript is single threaded, meaning that two bits of script cannot run at the same time; they have to run one after another. A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.

```javascript  
var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  // do thing, thenâ€¦

  if (/* everything worked */) {
    resolve("See, it worked!");
  }
  else {
    reject(Error("It broke"));
  }
});
```

## A Promise exists in one of these states:

  - pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
  - fulfilled: operation completed successfully.
  - rejected: operation failed.

The Promise object works as proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.

## Function Generators

In recent releases, JavaScript has introduced more ways to natively handle Promises. One such way is the function generator. Function generators are "pausable" functions. When used with Promises, generators can make using a lot easier to read and appear "synchronous".

```javascript
const myFirstGenerator = function* () {
  const one = yield 1;
  const two = yield 2;
  const three = yield 3;

  return 'Finished!';
}

const gen = myFirstGenerator();
```

Here's our first generator, which you can see by the `function*` syntax. The `gen` variable we declared will not run `myFirstGenerator`, but instead will "this generator is ready to use".

```javascript
console.log(gen.next());
// Returns { value: 1, done: false }
```

When we run `gen.next()` it will unpause the generator and carry on. Since this is the first time we have called `gen.next()` it will run `yield 1` and pause until we call `gen.next()` again. When `yield 1` is called, it will return to us the `value` that was yielded and whether or not the generator is `done`.

```javascript
console.log(gen.next());
// Returns { value: 2, done: false }

console.log(gen.next());
// Returns { value: 3, done: false }

console.log(gen.next());
// Returns { value: 'Finished!', done: true }

console.log(gen.next());
// Will throw an error
```
As we keep calling `gen.next()` it will keep going onto the next `yield` and pausing each time. Once there are no more `yield`'s left, it will proceed to run the rest of the generator, which in this case simply returns `'Finished!'`. If you call `gen.next()` again, it will throw an error as the generator is finished.

Now, imagine if each `yield` in this example was a `Promise`, the code itself would appear extremely synchronous. Libraries such as [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) make use of this to implement easier-to-understand side-effects in your Redux applications.
