title: Loops


A loop statement allows a statement or statements to repeat.

There are three types of loops: while loop, do-while loop, and for loop.

Format for while loop:

while (expression)
  statement;
 
 In a while loop:
 1. Expression is evaluated to be true or false
 2. If true, statement will execute
 3. Expression will be re-evaluated
 4. If false, the loop will terminate and content after statement will execute
 
 
 Format for do-while loop:
 
 do
		 statement;  // or block in { }
 while (expression);
 
 In a do-while loop:
 1. Loop executes at least once
 2. Expression is evaluated; if true then loop repeats
 3. If expression is false, loop terminates
 
 Format for for loop:
 
 for(initialization; test; update)
		   statement;
       
 1. Perform initialization
 2. Evaluate test; if true then execute statement, if false terminate loop
 3. Perform update then re-evaluate test
