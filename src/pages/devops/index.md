Some examples of Continous Integration platforms are Jenkins, Travis CI, TeamCity and GibLab CI. 

Continous integration is the process of automating the build and testing of code, an example of flow - A member of the team will commit a change to the version control repository, the change will be picked up by the continous integration platform with automated tests ran after checking out the commited code. Depending on how the pipeline is set up once the code has passed the tests it may then be built and deployed leading to a completed pipeline.
