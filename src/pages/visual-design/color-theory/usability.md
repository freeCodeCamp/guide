## Color and Usability

Like the variances in [representation of color by visual displays](index.md), the combination of human eye and brain interpret colors in a variety of ways.

About one in twenty people have color blindness.
Color blindness is when a variety of colors are interpreted as hues of one color. Sometimes a person does not know that they experience color blindness, because the colors "look normal" to them.  This has serious implications for contrasting colors between letters and their backgrounds, and for alerts, where color coveys a context of importance for example.

Over one percent of the population has [other kinds of significant visual loss (Wikipedia.org)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment).
Losses may include sensitivity to too much or too little contrast, distortions, and limits in the range of viewing clarity (near or far-sightedness).

A few guidelines can help to meet design challenges and accommodate both known and unknown issues that users may have while not adversely affecting the experience others.

The overall experience a person has when viewing your page is also determined by the color selection youâ€™ve made. For example, using light-gray or yellow color text on a white background makes it very tough for most people to read. This is due to a lack of contrast between the colors. Black text on a white background or white text on a blue background conversely has high contrast and will be easier to read.

Individuals who are affected by color-blindness might not be able to differentiate between similar colors as easily as you either. What you perceive as a wonderful palette of greens and blues might appear gray, beige, and dull to someone else. Importantly, if you choose a text color that views well for you, it might have much lower contrast than you realize to someone else, making it harder to understand the content you are trying to display.
