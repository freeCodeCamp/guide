## Hexcode

A number system with the base of 16 is called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>hexadecimal</a> which is the foundation of hexcode. If you put 2 hex-numbers together you have 256 distinct possibilities hence numbers. They often are indicated with the prefix '0x' or '#'. 

In web-development colors are often described as a set of 3 times those 2 packed hex-numbers, each pack representing a different color in the order of red, green, blue.
