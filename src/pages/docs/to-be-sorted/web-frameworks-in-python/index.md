Like most domains in Python development, the Python community treats web-development with great affection, and have given us matured, well-maintained frameworks; of varying complexity.

We have micro-frameworks like [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html). We also have frameworks like [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), which comes with [batteries included](https://github.com/rosarior/awesome-django). You can find a complete list of web-frameworks, written in Python, [over here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_frameworks#Python).
