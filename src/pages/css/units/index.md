## Units

CSS units are what you use to specify dimensions. Some main use cases of units are specifying margins, width and height.

### Fixed units
These units never change in size, and are fairly self explanatory.

##### `px`
Pixels - **this can depend on the resolution of the viewing device.** 
##### `cm`
Centimeters
##### `mm`
Millimeters
##### `in`
Inches

### Relative units
These size of these units can change based on factors such as the size of the screen or the font size.

##### `em`
Relative to the font-size of that element. 1rem is 1x the font-size, 2rem is 2x the font-size, etc.
##### `em`
Stands for root `em`. It is the `em` unit of the root element (the `<html>` element).
##### `vw`
Percentage of the viewport width. The viewport is the area of the actual page. `1vw` is 1% of the viewport width, so if you wanted to make an element be the width of the entire viewport you would use `100vw`.
##### `vh`
Same as `vw` except with the height of the viewport instead.
