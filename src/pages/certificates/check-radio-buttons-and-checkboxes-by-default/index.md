title: Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default
---
You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute.

To do this, just add the word "checked" to the inside of an input element. For example,
```html
    <input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>
```
