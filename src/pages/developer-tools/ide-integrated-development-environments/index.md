## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) 

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software that consolidates the basic tools developers need to write and test software in one application.

IDEs offer a central graphic user interface (GUI) that incorporates the following: a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, a debugger, and build automation tools.

A very commonly used example of an IDE is Atom. Atom is created and owned by GitHub and you can find out more about it at http://atom.io
