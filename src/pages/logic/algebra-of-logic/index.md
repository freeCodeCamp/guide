## Algebra of Logic

_Algebra of Logic_ or _Boolean algebra_ is a branch of mathematics. It deals with variables and their truth value. The variables have two possible states – _true_ & _false_.

It was first introduced by George Boole in his book The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847).

Boolean algebra is fundamental to the development of digital electronics. It is responsible for making possible all modern computing.

The three basic operations in Boolean Algebra are – _AND_, _OR_ and _NOT_. Consider two boolean variables `x` & `y`,

- _`x` AND `y`_ is true iff. both `x` and `y` are true.
- _`x` OR `y`_  is true iff. either of `x`, `y` are true.
- _NOT `x`_ is true iff. `x` is false and vice versa.
