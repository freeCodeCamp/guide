## What is R?
R is an open source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is one of the primary languages used by data scientists and statisticians alike. It is supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing and a large community of open source developers. 

## Programming features
* R is an interpreted language and users typically access it using command line interpreter.
* R's data structure consist of [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_vector), [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics), arrays, data frames and lists.
* R supports [procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming) with [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(computer_science)) and, for some functions, [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) with [generic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_function). 

## Popular R Tools & Packages
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) is a leading source for R tools and resources. 
* [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science.
* [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki) is an implementation of base `data.frame` focused on improved performance and terse, flexible syntax.
* [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) framework for building dashboard style web apps in R.
