## Div Tag

The `<div>` tag defines a section in your HTML document. The `<div>` element is used to group large sections of HTML elements together and format them with CSS.

### Example
Here is an example of how to display a section in same color:

```html
<div style="color:#ff0000">
  <h3>my heading</h3>
  <p>my paragraph</p>
</div>
```

The advantage of div tag is you can apply stylistic changes with CSS styles to the entire element. For example, if you put div tag around a paragraph, you can change the paragraph font by applying a font style change to the div tag instead of coding it on every paragraph element.
