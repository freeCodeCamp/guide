## Style Tag

The style tag is used sort of like a css file except inside of an HTML, like so:

```
    <head>
      <title>Your Title</title>
      <style>
        p {
          color:red;
        }
      </style>
    </head>
```

That would make the paragraph tag's color red. It is kind of useful if you just want to put a little bit of code, but if you want a really long stylesheet, then I recommend just using `<link />`.

More Info:

Style tag is used to set any CSS-styles for web-page inside a document. Style tag should be nested within head section of html-document:

```html
<head>
  <style>
  h1 {
     text-align: center;
     font-family: sans-serif;
     }
  </style>

You can write any CSS-code inside style tag according to its syntax.
