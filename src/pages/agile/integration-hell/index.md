Integration Hell is a step prior to deployment in the Waterfall development model.  When individual contributors merge their code, they often introduce breaking changes.  The code must be reviewed and bugs fixed prior to release.  This can be time consuming and frustrating if many lines of code were added before the bug was reported.

Continuous integration reduces the amount of time spent in Integration Hell.  Small changes are commited frequently, allowing for prompt identification and resolution of bugs.
