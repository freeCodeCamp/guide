The B tag is used to make the text placed between the tags as italic.
Here is an example on how to use them.

`<i>I am being displayed in italic</i>`

##### Note:
The text inside a B tag does not convey any meaning it is just to present or display the text in italic.
To indicate emphasis or stress use <em> tag instead of <i> tag.
