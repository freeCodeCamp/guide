## CSS Checkbox

The `:checked` pseudo-class in CSS selects elements when they are in the selected state. It is only associated with `<input>` elements of type radio and checkbox . The `:checked` pseudo-class selector matches radio and checkbox input types when checked or toggled to an on state. If they are not selected or checked, there is no match.

### Example CSS code

```
input[type=checkbox] + label {
  color: #ccc;
  font-style: italic;
} 
input[type=checkbox]:checked + label {
  color: #f00;
  font-style: normal;
} 
```

### Example HTML code

```
<input type="checkbox" id="ossm" name="ossm"> 
<label for="ossm">freeCodeCamp is awesome!</label> 
```
