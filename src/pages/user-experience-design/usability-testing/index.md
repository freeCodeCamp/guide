## Usability Testing

Usability testing is done to test the viability of a product or design. It can be done with anything from paper prototypes to simulated models (using something to simulate interaction, such as Invision or Axure) or with a coded final product. The tester begins with a product and develops a plan for testing, gathers participants then moderates the test and records the results. 

If possible, participants should be recruited that resemble personas that the team developed in the earlier phases of the design process. The testing plan usually includes scenarios for the participant to run through, or tasks to complete. The tester, or moderator, should refrain from influencing the participant or giving hints. The goal is to observe and record. This stage of the design process is done to verify that a concept or design actually works and also allows designers to catch issues early.
