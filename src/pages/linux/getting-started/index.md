## Installing.

Most Linux distributions are extremely easy to install, all information is show between each step of the installation.

One important step to look out for is when deciding where to install your new Linux distro. For first users it's better to choose the "Guided" option as it will do all the work for you.

Remember to read all the steps carefully and leave some space in your HDD for the new distro, i would say about 30Gb minimum is a nice to have.

## The dreaded Terminal.

Linux's terminal is not to be feared, actually it is quite easy to use with some practice and it can make our daily task greatly automated.

In Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives, the shortcut to open the cli (Comman Line Interface) is "Ctrl + Alt + T". Let's open the terminal and try some commands.

cd (Change Directory) - The cd command is one of the commands you will use the most at the command line in linux. It allows you to change your working directory. You use it to move around within the hierarchy of your file system.

```unix
cd
```

Using the cd command alone will change the current directory to your user home directory, located in "/home/username" as in "/home/mark".

ls (List) - This command list the content in the current directory. It can be also used to list file information.

```unix
ls
```
Now we can see our directories in our home.
