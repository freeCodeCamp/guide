## Redirect from an HTML Page

In HTML you can use `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://www.freecodecamp.org/" />` tag to redirect to another page. The use of the `<meta>` tag is not the preferenced way to create a link, HTTP Redirects are the standard however more often than not the developer does not have control over the server and cannot set HTTP Headers.
