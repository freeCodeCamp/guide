A frame is frequently used to embed document inside the HTML. It works in case of put some widgets like weather or a document.

What is <iframe> HTML tag?
------

<code>

alternative content for browsers which do not support iframe.
</iframe>
  </code>

Setting Height and Width of an iframe
------ 
The height and width attributes are used to specify the height and width of the iframe.

Third-Party Content Embedding
------ 
Today, iframes are most commonly used for sharing content from one site to another. Think of the third-party content you might want on your site – videos, audio, social sharing buttons, forms, documents, even ads. Most all of the providers of this content use iframes to facilitate the seamless integration of their content into your site. The primary benefit is that their third-party site has a separate window to work in, and they have full control over that window. At the same time, though, their little window is fully insulated from the rest of your page's content.

Code Example
------ 
<code>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/owsfdh4gxyc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </code>
