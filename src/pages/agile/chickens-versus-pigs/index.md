## Chickens Versus Pigs

"Chickens versus Pigs" refers to a story about a chicken and a pig, where the chicken proposes they open a restaurant called "Ham-n-Eggs".
The pig refuses, because while the chicken just needs to lay eggs, the pig has more at stake.

In an Agile software development project, the software developer is the pig. If you fail to complete the job, or fail to do it well,
you have a lot at stake. This could be your reputation, or maybe even your position. Other team members might also be considered pigs, 
depending on how much they have at stake. 

On the other hand, many team members are chickens. For example, the client or a high-level project manager would not really be impacted
by the failure of the project. They are interested in its success, and might make contributions, but have lower stakes and thus
have significantly less commitment to the project. 

You should strive to be a pig rather than a chicken. You can benefit from (but should not rely on) the chickens in order to minimize risk and
guarantee the project is delivered as efficiently as possible.
