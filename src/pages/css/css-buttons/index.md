## CSS Buttons

CSS buttons are a way to make normal buttons look amazing using CSS. They are set of styles that are applied to a normal button. 
###### Note : This article assumes that you already know CSS basics.

A basic example -
<img src="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9-JQMNx6A1aWEp5c0dHVjBOeVk" alt="The css button looks much better than the default as it is bigger, has more padding ,has no border,has a nice green background color with white text.">
  
Many CSS properties can be changed to give the button a custom look.
<ul>
<li>background-color</li>
<li>font-size</li>
<li>border</li>
<li>border-radius</li>
<li>padding</li>
<li>color</li>
<li>box-shadow for shadow effects</li>
</ul>
