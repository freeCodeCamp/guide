## Quantitative Surveys

Quantitative Research is a process of indirect assessment of the quality/usability of a design.
They can rely upon numerous factors like users performance on a given task (e.g. task-completion or success rates) 
or can show users' perception of usability (e.g satisfaction rating).

Quantitative methods are simply anything that we can count, numbers.

In Quantitative surveys, it can be hard to come up with the conclusion without a reference point, 
i.e. in absolute terms but relatively its easy that means we need a reference point for each survey.
For e.g., if only 70% of participants had completed the task in a study. We cannot conclude whether
its good or a bad result.

### Some quick points:

1. Deals with numbers, numerical data, and statistics.
2. Quantitative Surveys uses measurable data to conclude facts and patterns.
3. Quantitative Survey methodology is much more structured than Qualitative Survey.
