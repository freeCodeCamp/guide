## React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

It's declarative: React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application. It's efficient: React computes the minimal set of changes necessary to keep your DOM up-to-date. And it's flexible: React works with the libraries and frameworks that you already know.

To describe component's DOM representations, React uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. A simple transform is included with React that allows converting JSX into native JavaScript for browsers to digest.

Some requirements for using React:

1. Knowledges
    * Javascript, HTML, CSS
    * ECMAScript 2015
    * ECMAScript 2016 (optional)
2. Setup tools
    * Without CDN (recommended)
      * [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
      * [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
      * [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
    * With CDN
      * We have provide a [simple guide](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/react/a-react-environment-using-a-remote-code-repository) for this.

### Get Started
To get started using React, the most easy way is by using *[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)*. All the configurations such as webpack and webpack-dev-server have been configured by it.
