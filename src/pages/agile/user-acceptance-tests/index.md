User Acceptance Testing or UAT is a process of verifying that the solutions works for the users, it is different from system testing which is focused on ensuring software does not crash.

UAT is one of the final stages of a project and occurs before a user accepts the new system and the user acts as a final verification of the required business functionality and proper functioning of the system.

The users should test real-life scenarios such as:
 * The three most common tasks.
 * The three most difficult tasks.
