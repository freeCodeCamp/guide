#### Description

The ```<input>``` tag is one of the versatile form elements and allows you to create different interface elements and provide interaction with the user. Mainly <input> is intended for creating text fields, various buttons, switches and flags. Although the ```<input>``` element does not need to be placed inside the ```<form>``` container that defines the form, but if the user input is to be sent to the server where the server program processes it, then ```<form>``` is required. The same is true for data processing using client applications, for example, JavaScript scripts.
The main attribute of the ```<input>``` tag, which defines the type of the element is type. It allows you to specify the following form elements: text field, password field, radio switch, checkbox, hidden field, button, submit button, submit button, to clear the form (reset), the field to send the file (file) and the button with the image (image). For each element, there is a list of attributes that determine its appearance and characteristics. In addition, in HTML5 added more than a dozen new items.
