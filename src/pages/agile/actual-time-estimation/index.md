title: Actual Time Estimation
---
Stories and features that are created shouldn't be based off of an actual amount of time (minutes, hours, days, etc.). So what do the points then represent? To begin, pick the story that you think you understand the most about and can give a good estimate on exactly how long it will take. This story will be the baseline that all other story points are based off of. This makes all of the points relevant to each other instead of relating it directly to a time. This makes it easier to plan for velocity and gives a more accurate representation on the difficulty of the task at hand.
