## Focus

The :focus CSS pseudo-class is used to select the element that has focus (such as a form input).

It is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with the keyboard's "tab" key.

Syntax:

```css
:focus
```

## Example

HTML:

```html
<form>
  <input type="text" value="The background will turn yellow when you click on it.">
</form>
```

CSS:

```css
input:focus {
   background-color: yellow;
}
```
