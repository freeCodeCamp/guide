# Array
As we know that in JavaScript, Objects allow to store keyed collections of values.
but what if we find the need of *Ordered collection*, where we have first, second, third and so on elements.
There exists a special data structure named Array, to store ordered collections.

## Syntax
Two ways to declare Array in javascript:
```javacsript
let arr = new Array();
let arr = [];
```
example:
```javscript
let friends = ["Harshit", "Gaurav", "Rahul"];

alert( friends[0] ); // Harshit
alert( friends[1] ); // Gaurav
alert( friends[2] ); // Rahul
```
