## Doctype

Letting the browser know what type of document it is looking at is important! This can be done with the DOCTYPE element, and helps comply with standards across HTML. This element goes right at the top of the code, and does not require a closing tag.

Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
  
  </body>
</html>
```

#### More Information:

You may encounter old standards for DOCTYPE in old code.

For reference of these standards you can view: <a href="https://html.com/tags/doctype/" target="_blank">!DOCTYPE HTML tag</a>
