title: Python Built in Constants

Three commonly used built-in constants:

*   `True`: The true value of the _bool_ type. Assignments to `True` raise a _SyntaxError_.
*   `False`: The false value of the _bool_ type. Assignments to `False` raise a _SyntaxError_.
*   `None` : The sole value of the type _NoneType_. None is frequently used to represent the absence of a value, as when default arguments are not passed to a function. Assignments to `None` raise a _SyntaxError_.

Other built-in constants:

*   `NotImplemented`: Special value which should be returned by the binary special methods, such as `__eg__()`, `__add__()`, `__rsub__()`, etc.) to indicate that the operation is not implemented with respect to the other type.
*   `Ellipsis`: Special value used mostly in conjunction with extended slicing syntax for user-defined container data types.	
*   `__debug__`: True if Python was not started with an -o option.
