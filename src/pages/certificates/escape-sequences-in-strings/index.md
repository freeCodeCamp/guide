title: Escape Sequences in Strings
---
Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. Here is a table of common escape sequences:

**Code** | **Output**  
-------- | ---------------  
\' | single quote  
\" | double quote  
\ | backslash  
\n | new line  
\r | carriage return  
\t | tab  
\b | backspace  
\f | form feed

_Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash._
