## Code Smells

A code smell resides in a part of source code that usually indicates a deeper problem.<sup>1</sup>
A code smell does not represent a bug by itself; it means that the code smell does not affect the functionality of the product. It would be more accurately qualified as a weakness in the code that may slow down development or refactoring. It may also increase the bug possibilities.
Some examples of code smells may be <em>duplicated code</em> or <em>excessive number of parameters</em>.

As a result, it is important yet easy, even for beginners, to spot and reduce code smells. Thus, clean and bring robustness to the code.

This kind of problems are referred as a <em>value system</em><sup>2</sup> for the software developer; Indeed, this kind of problems allows to evaluate the technical debt of a project.
