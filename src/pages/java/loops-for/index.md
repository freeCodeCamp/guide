# Java for Loop

There are 2 of these:

1.  Normal `for` loop

```java
for(initialize variable; condition; modify variable){  
    //perform action  
}
```

For e.g.

```java  
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){  
    System.out.println("The value of is : " + i);  
}
```

1.  Enhanced `for` loop / forEach loop

Well, this came into existence in Java 5\. It helps when you are required to iterate over a list of items and perform some action like so:

```java
// assuming nameList is a List of names that are actually Strings
Iterable<String> nameList = ...
for(String name : nameList ){  
    System.out.println(name);  
}
```
