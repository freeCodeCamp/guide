## Search Algorithms

Searching algorithms are a set of instructions that take an array (or list) and an item as an input and tries to locate the item in the array.

Some algorithms can also tell when the item is not present in the array.

## Why Searching Algorithms are Important

We often work with large data sets in Computer Science. Search algorithms are important to get precise members of those sets. These algorithms have direct applications in data structure algorithms and many more.


## Some Common Sorting Algorithms

Some of the most common searching algorithms are:

* Binary Search
* Jump Search
* Linear Search
