## CSS Preprocessors

CSS Preprocessors enable front-end developers to write code using a preprocessing syntax, which is then compiled to CSS. While this may sound like added complexity if you are just learning CSS, most preprocessers use a syntax that looks and feels very similar to the CSS you have already learned. The advantage to using a preprocessor lies in being able to use extra functionality that is not available in regular CSS, such as variables, mixins, and nesting.

Two of the most common CSS preprocessors are <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> and <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a>.
