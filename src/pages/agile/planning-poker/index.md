## Planning Poker
Planning poker is an estimation technique. It is often part of Agile Coache's toolboxes. 

Each estimator holds poker cards with various values (often Fibonacci Sequence numbered). The value represents the number of days, workforces, story points or any kind of estimation that the team wants to meet in common. Then Product Owner (PO) / stakeholder explains the feature / item to estimate. The team can ask questions and discuss with PO to get a better understanding on *what* she/he wants. 

After the end of the discussion, each person selects a card which shows their estimation. Then they reveal it at the same time. It is of high value to the team to have the team members with lowest and highest estimates discuss, why they have picked so different estimations. 

Because Planning Poker is a tool to moderate a *joint* expert estimation, it leads to a better common understanding and perhaps refinement of the feature request. So Planning Poker is even of high value when the team is operating in a No-Estimates mode. As moderator try to avoid confirmation bias.
