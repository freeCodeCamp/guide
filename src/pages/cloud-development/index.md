Cloud development typically includes integrated development environments, application lifecycle management components (such as test and quality management, source code and configuration management, continuous delivery tools), and application security testing components.

Although technology executives and developers with experience in cloud-based development say there are clear benefits to developing in these environments such as costs savings and increased speed to market.

In a February 2011 research note, Gartner said clients that attended the firm's symposia in 2010 expressed "sharply increased interest" in cloud computing to enhance the development and maintenance of existing custom Web applications.

"I see it the most in prototyping and parallel branch development, but there's also huge growth in the load- and performance-testing space," says Eric Knipp, a principal research analyst at Gartner.

Benefits of cloud apps

Fast response to business needs. Cloud applications can be updated, tested and deployed quickly, providing enterprises with fast time to market and agility. This speed can lead to culture shifts in business operations.

Simplified operation. Infrastructure management can be outsourced to third-party cloud providers.

Instant scalability. As demand rises or falls, available capacity can be adjusted.

API use. Third-party data sources and storage services can be accessed with an application programming interface (API). Cloud applications can be kept smaller by using APIs to hand data to applications or API-based back-end services for processing or analytics computations, with the results handed back to the cloud application. Vetted APIs impose passive consistency that can speed development and yield predictable results.

Gradual adoption. Refactoring legacy, on-premises applications to a cloud architecture in steps, allows components to be implemented on a gradual basis.

Reduced costs. The size and scale of data centers run by major cloud infrastructure and service providers, along with competition among providers, has led to lower prices. Cloud-based applications can be less expensive to operate and maintain than equivalents on-premises installation.

Improved data sharing and security. Data stored on cloud services is instantly available to authorized users. Due to their massive scale, cloud providers can hire world-class security experts and implement infrastructure security measures that typically only large enterprises can obtain. Centralized data managed by IT operations personnel is more easily backed up on a regular schedule and restored should disaster recovery become necessary.
