## Glossary

A quick one or two sentences describing common terms. See individual pages for
more details.

- **Machine Learning** - Intersection of statistics and computer science in
  order to teach computers to perform tasks without explicitly being programmed.
  - **Deep Learning** - An umbrella terms of machine learning methods based on learning data representations as opposed to algorithms based on fulfilling a given task. It include architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks.
- **Statistical Learning** - the use of machine learning with the goal of
  statistical inference, whereby you make conclusions of the data rather than
  focus on prediction accuracy
- **Supervised Learning** - Using historical data to predict the future. Example: Using historical data of prices at which houses were sold to predict the price in which your house will be sold. Regression and Classification come under supervised learning.
- **Unsupervised Learning** - Finding patterns in unlabelled data. Example: Grouping customers by purchasing behaviour. Clustering comes under unsupervised learning.
- **Regression** - A machine learning technique used to predict continous values. Linear Regression is one of the most popular regression algorithm.  
- **Classification** - A machine learning technique used to predict discrete values. Logistic Regression is one of the most popular classification algorithm.
```
f: x -> y  

Here 'f' is a function that takes 'x' as input and produces 'y' as output.

If the output value 'y' is a real number / continous value then the function 
is a regression technique.  

If the output value 'y' is a discrete / categorical value then the function is a classification technique.
```  
- **Clustering** - Grouping of unlabelled data. Identifying patterns using statistics.
