## Defining Brands
A designer can’t “make” a brand. Or design a brand. Designers design a brand identity that reflects a brand.

The branding itself has to come from the company. From their brand strategy.

What are some of their core values?
What do they stand for?
What makes their product unique?
What is their unique selling point?
Who are their target customers?
Questions like this form the basis of a brand strategy and should be established within the company in the first instance. A designer or design agency builds the foundation of a brand, or is brought in to enhance the brand’s visual and corporate identity
