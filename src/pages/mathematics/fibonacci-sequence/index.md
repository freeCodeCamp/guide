## Fibonacci Sequence

A Fibonacci sequence is the on which each term is obtained by summing the two previous terms, like so:

 0 , 1, 0 + 1, 1 + 1, 2 + 1, 3 + 2, ...
 
 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 ...
 
The Fibonacci sequence is named after Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci. His 1202 book Liber Abaci introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics, although the sequence had been described earlier in Indian mathematics.

The Fibonacci numbers are important in the computational run-time analysis of Euclid's algorithm to determine the greatest common divisor of two integers: the worst case input for this algorithm is a pair of consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

Fibonacci sequence may occur in nature, for example in the seeds of sunflower grow in fibonacci spirals.

A Fibonacci spiral is a series of connected quarter-circles drawn inside an array of squares with Fibonacci numbers for dimensions.

The squares fit perfectly together because of the nature of the sequence, where the next number is equal to the sum of the two before it. Any two successive Fibonacci numbers have a ratio very close to the Golden Ratio, which is roughly 1.618034.
