title: Python More Built in Types
---
The following sections describe the standard types that are built into the interpreter.

The principal built-in types are numerics, sequences, mappings, classes, instances and exceptions.

Some collection classes are mutable. The methods that add, subtract, or rearrange their members in place, and donâ€™t return a specific item, never return the collection instance itself but None.
