## NP Completeness

In computer science, NP stands for Non-Deterministic Polymonial time, which simple means there is no known algorithm that could solve that particular problem in polynomial time. The <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem">P vs NP</a> problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science and one of the seven <a herf = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_mathematics">Millennium Prize Problem</a>. Few famous NP complete problems are <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem">Boolean Satisfiability Problem</a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem">Knapsack Problem</a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">Travelling Salesman Problem</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_cover">Vertex Cover Problem</a>.
