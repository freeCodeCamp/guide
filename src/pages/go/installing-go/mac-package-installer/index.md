### Installing Go in Mac OS X using Package Installer

From the [golang's download page](https://golang.org/dl/), get the Mac package installer (ending in .pkg) and run it.

#### Check installation and version of go

To check if go was successfully installed, open your terminal and use:

```sh
$ go version
```
This should print to the console the version of go, while at the same time making sure the installation went smoothly.
