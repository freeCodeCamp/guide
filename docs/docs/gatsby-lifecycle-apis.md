title: Gatsby Lifecycle APIs
---

Rough outline

* Rich set of lifecycle APIs to hook into Gatsby's bootstrap, build, and
client operations.
* Code > convention
* Easy to modularize code into plugins (link to plugin page).
* Plugins are easy to open source and reuse. They're just NPM packages.
Link to list of plugins.
* Link to full reference documentation of all lifecycle APIs.
