## React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- It's declarative: React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application. 
- It's efficient: React computes the minimal set of changes necessary to keep your DOM up-to-date.
- It's flexible: React works with the libraries and frameworks that you already know.

To describe component's DOM representations, React uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. 
JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. 
A simple transform is included with React that allows converting JSX into native JavaScript for browsers to digest.

The simplest way to get started with React on your computer is by installing
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The quickstart is as follows, assuming you have Node/NPM installed:

```bash
npm i -g create-react-app

create-react-app my-first-react-app
cd my-first-react-app
npm start
```

This will launch a bootstrapped React app in directory called `my-first-react-app`.

You will be able to edit code and watch it live reload in your browser.
