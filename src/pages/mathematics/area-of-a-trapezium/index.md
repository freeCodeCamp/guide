title: Area of a Trapezium
---
a trapezium is a quadrilateral only with one pair of parallel sides

area of a  trapezium = area of a rectangle+area of a triangle
                      =bh+1/2(a-b)*h
                      =h[b+1/2(a-b)]
                      =h[2b/2+(a-b)/2]
                      =h[2b+(a-b)]/2
                      =h(a+b)/2
                      =(half the sum of parallel sides)*(perpendicular distance between the parallel sides)
                      
 therefore area is h(a+b)/2
