## Turn an Image into a Link

In a previous challenge you already achieved the task to nest a HTML element into another (e.g. [Nest an anchor element within a paragraph](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/nest-an-anchor-element-within-a-paragraph) )

Now you are asked to solve the same problem with different tags: just put the image ( as is ) within the anchor element and it will become the clickable content of that anchor.

Good luck!
