In supervised learning, we know what the correct output should be. Supervised learning problems can be categorized into regression and classification. A regression problem is where you map input to a continuous output. A classification problem, in contrast, is where you map (group) inputs into discrete categories.

Discussion points:

- Supervised learning is task when you have a response you're trying to predict
- Ideas of training data to use
- Use test data to test learning from training data
- Think about complexity of learning model
- Should validate your learning with methods such as cross-validation
- Should be wary of overfitting
- Give examples e.g. logistic regression, support vector machines, neural networks

Takeaway points:

- What is special about supervised learning?
- In what scenario would you use it in?
- Caveats or traps to think about?
- What are some example models?
