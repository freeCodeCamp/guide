## SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the most common tool used to manipulate data in a relational database (often referred to as a "SQL database"). It is a querying language, not a programming language. The main function of SQL is to insert, update, delete and query data. 

SQL is commonly pronounced as "sequel." Its most popular variants are Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft Access, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite - a version of SQL which is commonly used for prototyping.
