# Fetch

When working with a cloned remote file.
An easy way to see if changes have been made to the remote and bring the changes down to your local copy is with Git Fetch.
This command will not merge changes from the remote into your local repository. It brings those changes onto what's called a remote branch. 
Example output below: 

 git fetch

remote: Counting objects: 5, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Total 5 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (5/5), done.
