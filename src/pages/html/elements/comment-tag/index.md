## Comment Tag

Comments are tags used to leave notes in the document. Only the developer have access to the comments, the final user don't see unless they check with the browser's Inspector Element.

When you're working in some code, it's helpful to leave tips to others developers in order to understand what the work is about.

### Example

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
```
