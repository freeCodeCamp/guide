## What is GIMP?

GIMP is an open source raster image editing program available for Linux, MacOS, and Microsoft Windows. GIMP has a very similar user interface to Adobe Photoshop so a user experienced in one program should have a easy transition into the other. Since GIMP is open source, there are many features and extensions available such as the GIMP Animation Package (GAP) and Resynthesizer that allows for a “content aware fill” feature.
