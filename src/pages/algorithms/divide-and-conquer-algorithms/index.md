## Divide and Conquer Algorithms

Divide and Conquer is a popular recursive algorithmic paradigm. This approach involves three steps:
Step 1 - 
  Dividing the bigger problem into many smaller, independent subproblems.
Step 2 - 
  Solving subproblems recursively.
Step 3 -
  Combining solution of subproblems to get the solution to the original problem.

A subproblem must not be dependent on other subproblem for its solution.
