## Sketch

Sketch is a design toolkit for macOS only. It quickly became very popular as an alternative to Photoshop for user interface design as it's much cheaper and has a low learning curve. 

### How Sketch License works

When you buy Sketch, you get a lifelong usage license with free updates for one year. After an year, if you don't renew your license, you can still use the latest version you downloaded for as long as you wish and also be eligible for critical bug fix updates.
