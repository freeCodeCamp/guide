## Ddos Distributed-Denial of Service Attacks

DDOS is an attack that is used to exaust a server resources, eventually rendering it too busy to serve legitimate users.
These attacks can exhaust limited resources like: CPU, memory, network sockets and disk drive input-output.
There is a wide range of attack vectors and tools, but they all share a common goal to make a website or web service unreachable for legitimate users.

One attack vector includes using a group of computers connected to the internet, usually infected by a trojan (botnet), to send a large amount of requests to the victim servers, thus consuming its resources or causing network congestion. This way users can no longer reach the site or service. 

Solutions to this attack include identifying attack traffic and redirecting it to a dedicated network device, uknown as Intrustion Detection System (IDS)/Intrustion Prevention System (IPS), that blocks the attack traffic from reaching the servers while allowing legitimate users access.
