## Algorithms

An algorithm is like a recipe. It's a series of steps you take in order to achieve a specific outcome.It is the core of every program .You can determine how good a program is by seeing the algorithm used in it.

There are programmers who develop their own algorithms which might be complex at first by seeing.But if you have a good knowledge about algorithms like how they work and what they do, then you will be able to understand them as well as use them.

Some common types of algorithms include sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and compression algorithms.

freeCodeCamp's curriculum heavily emphasizes creating algorithms. This is because learning algorithms is a good way to practice programming skills. Interviewers most commonly test candidates on algorithms during developer job interviews.

A really good way to improve those programming skills using the algorithms you leaerned is competitive programming.
