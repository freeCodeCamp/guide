title: Call Out Optional Actions with Button Info
---
Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The `btn-info` class is used to call attention to optional actions that the user can take. Note that these buttons still need the `btn` and`btn-block` classes.

    <button class= "btn btn-block btn-info">Info</button>
