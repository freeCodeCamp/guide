## Web Safe Fonts
Font choice is one of the most discussed topics when it comes to design, it is often the line between well designed websites and poorly designed ones. We all have our favorite fonts, however, sometimes others do not have access to these fonts, or your fonts CDN might have failed on you. When users can't see your `Playfair Display` and `Roboto`, they are revered to the default font, which nobody appreciates, to prevent this disaster from happening, it is recommended to declare generic default fonts when stating the font family using one of the websafe fonts:
```css
   body{
    font-family: "Roboto", Arial, sans-serif
   }
```
or
```css
   body{
    font-family: "Playfair Display", "Times New Roman", serif
   }
```
