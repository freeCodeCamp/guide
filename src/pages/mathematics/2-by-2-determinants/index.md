## 2 by 2 Determinants

For a 2Ã—2 matrix, its determinant is found by subtracting the products of its diagonals, which is a fancy way of saying in words what the following says in pictures:

For a 2x2 matrix, adjoint of a matrix is given by interchanging the right diagonal elements and reversing the signs of left diagonal elements : for eg : |5 3| 
                    |6 2|

will changed to |2 -3|
                |-6 5|
