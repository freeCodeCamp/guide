## Learn About Self-Closing JSX Tags

### Hint 1

Any tag is self-closed in React like this:
````javascript
<tagName />
````
pay emphasis on the front-slash, that's how tage are closed

### Solution

To finish the challenge, we will correct the open HTML tags, which have not been self closed, like so:

````javascript
const JSX = (
  <div className="myDiv">
    <h1>Add a class to this div</h1>
  </div>
);
````
