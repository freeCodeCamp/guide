title: Use a CSS Class to Style an Element
---
Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements. You can apply a class to an HTML element like this: `<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>`.

Note that in your CSS style element, classes should start with a period. In your HTML elements' class declarations, classes shouldn't start with a period.
