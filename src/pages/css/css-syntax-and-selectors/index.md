## CSS Syntax and Selectors
### CSS Syntax
The basic syntax for any CSS property is,
```css
 selector {
              property : property-value ; 
          }
```
the whole structure is called a "rule set".  The "Property" and "Property-value" can be grouped together to be called as a "Declaration"

### Selectors
Selectors select(s) the element to be styled.
### Property
Ways in which you can style a given HTML element.
### Property-value
To the right of the property after the colon, we have the property-value, which chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property
### Declaration
A single rule, specifying the property to be styled
