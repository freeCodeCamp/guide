## Code Smells

A Code Smell is a sign that there may be a deeper problem with your code, that *may* require refactoring to fix it.

An example of a code smell is duplicated code. It may indicate that you need to generalize the code into a function and call it in two places, or it may be that the way the code works in one place is completely unrelated to the way it works in another place, despite having been copied.

There are many more examples of code smells. See the references below.
