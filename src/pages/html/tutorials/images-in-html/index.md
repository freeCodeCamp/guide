## Images in HTML

You can define images by using the <img> tag.
It does not have a closing tag since it can contain only attributes.

To insert an image you define the source and an alternative text wich is displayed when
the image can not be rendered.

```html
<img src="URL of the Image" alt="Descriptive Title" />
```

### To define height and width of an image you can use the height and width attribute:
```html
<img src="URL of the Image" alt="Descriptive Title" height="100" width="150"/>
```

### You can also define border thickness (0 means no border):
```html
<img src="URL of the Image" alt="Descriptive Title" border="2"/>
```

### Align an image:
```html
<img src="URL of the Image" alt="Descriptive Title" align="left"/>
```

### You are also able to use styles within a style attribute:
```html
<img src="URL of the Image" alt="Descriptive Title" style="width: 100px; height: 150px;"/>
```
