## Center Tag

The `<center>` tag is an element that where all children elements are centered horizontally within the parent container.

### Example
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
        <center>This text is centered.
        <p>This paragraph is also centered.</p></center>
	</body>
</html>
```

### Note
This tag deprecated in HTML 4 for the CSS property `text-align`, which can be applied to the `<div>` element or to an individual `<p>` for alignment needs.

See: [text-align](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align)
