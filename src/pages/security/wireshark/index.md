## Wireshark

Wireshark is a free and open source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development (and education). You can download it here: https://www.wireshark.org/

Wireshark is very similar to tcpdump, but has a graphical front-end, plus some integrated sorting and filtering options.

This is a resource where Julia Evans explains how you can use tcpdump to diagnose a slow HTTP request, coupled with using Wireshark to analyze the traffic: https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/03/16/tcpdump-is-amazing/
