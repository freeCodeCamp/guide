Take a minute to look through here and figure out what’s going on. These functions will: return all items in a collection, return a single item from a collection when passed its id, post an item to a collection, update an item in the collection (this doesn’t really work as intended out of the box, we’re going to fix that in a minute), and of course, delete an item from the collection.</li>\n<li><strong>thing.model.js</strong>: Here, the actual structure of a <em>thing</em> object is defined.
