## Steganography

Steganography is the​ practice​ of​ hiding messages​ anywhere​ they’re​ not expected‏‎.
In the past it was all about invisible ink and letters with hidden information.

With Digital steganography message can be hidden in image, audiofile, or a video.
Flipping a few bits​ doesn’t change​ the​ file to​ the​ human​ eye (or ear). But if you know which bytes to flip where, you can easily decode the message.
