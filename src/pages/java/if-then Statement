## if-then
The `if-then`statement is one of the most basic statements. It tells your program to execute a certain section of code `only if´a particular test evaluates to ´true´.
For example,the `match`class would `only` allow the players to roll the dice `if` it is their turn. This could be like the following:

```java
void match() {
    // the "if" clause: it must be the players turn
    if (yourTurn) {
      //the "then" clause: roll the dice
      rollTheDice;
    }
}
```

If this test (is it the players turn) evaluates to `false`, control jumps to the end of the `if-then`statement.
