## Key Value Databases

A key-value database, also called a key-value store, is the most flexible type of NoSQL database. Key-value databases have emerged as an alternative to many of the limitations of traditional relational databases, where data is structured in tables and the schema must be predefined. 

The key-value part refers to the fact that the database stores data as a collection of key/value pairs. This is a simple method of storing data, and it is known to scale well.

The key-value pair is a well established concept in many programming languages. Programming languages typically refer to a key-value as an associative array or data structure. A key-value is also commonly referred to as a dictionary or hash.

Examples of Key-Value Stores
```
Name(Key)	ID(Value)
Dave		32
Rick		47
Tom		99
```
The key must be unique.The key can be of any format but the maximum size of that a key can occupy depends on type of DBMS.
The value in a key-value store can be anything such as text,number,list etc.

Examples where Key-Value Database can be used -

1) Ecommerce - for storing food name as key and its price as value.
```
Food-Name	Food-Value
Butter		50
Drink		70
```
2) Student Records in School/College - The student records can be maintained where Key will be student name and Value will be a list of student
details.
```
Student Name	Student Details(Age,Sex,City)

Dave		[23,Male,NY]
Rick		[24,Male,Los Angeles]
```
