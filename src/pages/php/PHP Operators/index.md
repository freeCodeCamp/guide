Operators are responsible for performing mathematical, logical and relational operations.
It performs operations on variables and values.

PHP consists of following operators:
##### Arithmetic Operators  
These operators are used with numeric values to perform common arithmetical operations, such as addition, division,
modulus, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

| Operator      |                 Description                                     | 
| ------------- |:---------------------------------------------------------------:| 
|      +        |     Adds two operands                                           | 
|      -        |     Subtracts second operand from the first                     | 
|      *        |     Multiply both operands                                      |  
|      /        |     Divide numerator by de-numerator                            |     
|      %        |     Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division |
|      ++       |	    Increment operator, increases integer value by one	        | 
|      --       |	    Decrement operator, decreases integer value by one          |
