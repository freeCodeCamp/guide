In User Experience Design, personas are imaginary but distinct personalities defined in order to help in designing the product. By imagining a small number of possible users representing distinct user-types, it becomes easier to gain empathy for the needs of the users, and in prioritizing features or styles. 

To facilitate a natural sense of empathy that comes when thinking of real people, we assign a name, age, family-background, work-background etc. (even a face) to a persona, rather than making it an all-encompassing generic category of users. For instance, we will imagine a persona as Alice, age 27, post-doctoral candidate, spends 30 mins both ways travelling between living quarters and university, uses an iPhone and a Macbook etc., rather than a generic category of users between ages 24-30 who are university students and travel by bus. Thus, to make a persona effective, the more personal the better.
