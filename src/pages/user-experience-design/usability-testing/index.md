## Usability Testing

### What is usability testing? (Short Answer)

Usability testing is a way to see how easy to use something is by testing it with real users.

Users are asked to complete tasks, typically while they are being observed by a researcher, to see where they encounter problems and experience confusion. If more people encounter similar problems, recommendations will be made to overcome these usability issues.
