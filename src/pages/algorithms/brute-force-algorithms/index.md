## Brute Force Algorithms

From the name itself, Brute Force algorithms make use of straightforward approaches in order to solve a problem. Algorithms that make use of brute force are the easiest ones to apply.

The following are well-known Brute Force Algorithms:

Selection Sort
- Selection Sort is an algorithm that sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (ascending order) or the maximum element (descending order) from the unsorted part and puts it in the beginning.
 
Bubble Sort
- Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

Sequential Search
- Sequential Search is a searching algorithm that compares a "search key" to every element of a list until it matches.

String Matching
- String Matching algorithms work by finding a substring from a larger string.
