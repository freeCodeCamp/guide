## Intro to Matrices
A matrices is composed by a 2D array, or better, a rectangular array. Below you can see how its organized.

It is composed by rows, and columns. So if you want the number 7 of the matrix below, you need to get the element on the posicion (2,3), second row, third column.

The usuals operations works for matrices, but adddiotion and subtraction is made on the elements of the same position (so the two matrices needs to have the same size). Multiplication is different so matrix A x matrix B, A needs to have the same size of transpose of B. 

Transpose is the operations of inver the rows and columns of a matrix.
