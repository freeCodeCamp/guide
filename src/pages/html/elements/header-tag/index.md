## Header Tag

`<header></header>` is new to HTML5. This tag acts as a container for introductory content or even a set of navigational links.
Inside a header tag you may see something like this, however they can contain more than one heading element, logos and other important information:
```html
<header>
  <h1>Title goes here</h1>
  <p>additional information here</p>
</header>
```
Heading elements range from:
# `<h1></h1>`
## `<h2></h2>`
### `<h3></h3>`
#### `<h4></h4>`
##### `<h5></h5>`
###### `<h6></h6>`
Typically you would use a `<h1>` for a very important title and a `<h6>` for something not as important
