## Define a Redux Action

There are three parts to this challenge.

1. Declare an `action` object.
2. Give it a `type` property.
3. Set the property's value to `'LOGIN'`.

### Step 1. Declare an object.

```javascript
const yourObjectName = {};
```

### Steps 2 & 3. Give your object a property and set its value.

```javascript
const yourObjectName = {
  propertyName: value
};
```

Good luck!
