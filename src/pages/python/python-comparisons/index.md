There are eight comparison operations in Python. They all have the same priority (which is higher than that of the Boolean operations). Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily; for example, `x < y <= z` is equivalent to `x < y and y <= z`, except that `y` is evaluated only once (but in both cases `z` is not evaluated at all when `x < y` is found to be false).

This table summarizes the comparison operations:

Operation | Meaning  
--------- | -----------------------  
`<` | strictly less than  
`<=` | less than or equal  
`>` | strictly greater than  
`>=` | greater than or equal  
`==` | equal  
`!=` | not equal  
`is` | object identity  
`is not` | negated object identity

Objects of different types, except different numeric types, never compare equal. Furthermore, some types (for example, function objects) support only a degenerate notion of comparison where any two objects of that type are unequal. The `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` operators will raise a `TypeError` exception when comparing a complex number with another built-in numeric type, when the objects are of different types that cannot be compared, or in other cases where there is no defined ordering.

Non-identical instances of a class normally compare as non-equal unless the class defines the `__eq__()` method.

Instances of a class cannot be ordered with respect to other instances of the same class, or other types of object, unless the class defines enough of the methods `__lt__()`, `__le__()`, `__gt__()`, and `__ge__()` (in general, `__lt__()` and `__eq__()` are sufficient, if you want the conventional meanings of the comparison operators).

The behavior of the is and is not operators cannot be customized; also they can be applied to any two objects and never raise an exception.

**TODO**

*   Chained comparisons w < x < y > z
*   Equality comparison `is` vs `==`
