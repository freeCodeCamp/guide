## Daily Standup and Daily Scrum

The goal of the daily standup is to quickly bring the entire team up speed on each individual's progress, and to identify major obstacles that need to be overcome. 

This meeting usually takes place at the same time every day and the entire team has to physically stand up for the duration of the meeting to ensure that the meeting does not become unnecessarily  lengthy. Each member of the team takes turns to speak, and they have to concisely answer all of the following three questions:
  - What have you done since our last meeting?
  - What are you going to do next?
  - What's holding you back?

Team members are to listen carefully to each other's contributions and attempt to identify areas where they can assist each other's progress. The standup meeting will also surface more lengthy topics of discussion that need to take place between different members of the team. These lengthier discussions that arise should then be halted and taken outside of the standup, involving only the relevant participants, and not the entire team.
